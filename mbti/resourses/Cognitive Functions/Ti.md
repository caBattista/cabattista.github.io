#### Peronality Type: Judging (Deciding)
#### Inverse: Te

### Description

#### CSJ

+ Logic, If Else, True, False, (Process), My logic
+ Individual True false Judgement
+ Have one Table with 100 Thoughts, and are going true false on each one on a case by case basis really quick
+ On Axis with extroverted Feeling
+ If this happens than that than happens
+ If this happenes I'm going to make this decision
+ A person can actually arrive at actuial truth, because they do it individually and not collectively
+ 'Ad Homonim' is FE in a logical argument -> I think therefore you feel
+ If you have a emotional reaction this gives me a true false judgement about you
+ In contrast if you give me a feeling Judgement you give me a (rational) label judgement
+ Emotional tinge to truth: Oh you are being argumentitive, No Im just telling you the truth
+ People have an emotional reaction to truth
+ Abortion is ok: Some one says no I dont think so and not No i dont feel so
+ All cognitive Function come out in how we speak (what words we use), or basically anthing like dringking jamba juice
+ Cognitive Funktions are Frequencies of which your brain and mind can tune into for decision making and information gathering
+ ISTP: The mechanic will use it to logically figure out a mechanical system (Invent this amazing skateboard with an engine atached to it and then they are crazy enough to try it out)
+ ESTP: Is there for lookiing at existing systems / structures and testing if they are true and if the rules are actually worth being there.
+ By putting them into practice and giving others feedback about the experience
+ Intentionally break the rule in front of others, to see the other reaction and see if there is a reason to have that rule there
+ Will tear down the entire system and replace it with something better, take parts out of it and replace them with new parts
+ Entps more focused on the vision and about what new system could we bring in later (Same perspective as ESTP but more future oriented)
+ INTPS: are similar but they want to controll ervery aspect of the system to make it great, pice by piece, but if they find out if a pice isn't right they simple use another one (They can do this really quickly)
+ The only way to defeat TI Hero is with a lot of rationale only for them to concider your point (Get a lot of statistics etc. to convince them)
+ TI - Can get stuck in its thinking, but thats whats rational and ethics is for to balance it out
+ People with high TI tend to get labeled as arogant, because they are so focused on whats true but it's not about how they feel about it, because absolute truth is a real thing and undeniable
+ Ti is all about improving, bacuse it causes the ethics to care for others and make them better
+ TI is like fire it burns and purifies things (Harsh Truth)
+ If they find any logical flaws in your argument they'll reject it entirely
