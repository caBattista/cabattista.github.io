# Cognitive Function: Introverted Feeling (Fi)

#### Peronality Type: Judging (Deciding)
#### Inverse: Fe

### Description

I honestly find it a bit sad how many people think Fi is associated with selfishness or sympathy alone.  
#### Fi feels everything within themselves...

so they don't just bring a scene from a persons life in to themselves when they empathize with them, they need to gather enough information to actually build certain emotions and values based on the information the person gives them about their personality and emotional life.

#### CSJ
+ Morals, (Feedback), My feelings
+ Like TE but Morals
+ Use morals for their feeling based judgements / decisions
+ Personal: good bad (value) judgement
+ Feeling if something is a good or a bad thing
+ Sometimes say that they feel that somthing is true or false, but this not the right whay to do it because its using feeling where ther should be thingking happening
+ Your truth vs my truth: but thats also wrong, but introverted feeling has nothing to do with logic
+ Fi users asks Te users about what they think (I feel you think)
+ INFP: Dosile, go at their own pace, like to be comfy have a good experience at all times.
+ INFP: As soon as they are made uncomfortable their (fi/si?) Hero start screaming this is not good, which immediately springs them into action. This is also how you motivate them.
+ INFP: Sometimes the infp can outlast you forever and do what ever they can to outlast you.... but as long as you stay persistant you will win...
+ INFP: Want to feel good about how people think of them
+ Have an emotional (moral) response to the facts or data, when watching the news, statstics, article, people with credentials, trust in credentials
+ Need to be balanced out by TI/FE (logical / Ethical) users
+ But the the moral compas of the FI user can become the ethics of the FE user by absorbing that FI energy
+ Sometimes people say 'What do you thin about this' but they really mean 'what do you feel about this'
+ FI hero instantly knows how they feel about everything, but you'll neever know it because its an introverted function
+ They my not share it because it wouldn't be good to bring this up right now, because then they will start thinking some thins, and then I'll feel bad and then there will be conflict, bacuse that will bring me out of my comfort zone or jsut not right now
+ ENTJS, INTJS, ISTJ... Low FI users take the rational decisions more seriously instead of the moral one. ENTJs being accused of being the most greedy of all the types. ESTJs being overly controlling because they hate caos
+ Fe users absorb FIs feeling and remember their reaction with SI to plan their interactions, so then that makes the FE user look better than the FI user in social interaction, even though the FI user is actually the true source of social interaction
+ People who are 'social' are actually just gaming/manipulation around the FI users (although 100% of social interaction is manipulation)
+ Would Imagine themselves being famous, INFP Woman: The Wife of a star, The ENTJ the best CEO, ESTJ a gold medalist at the olympics
+ FI wants to feel status, because it feels good to them, but its all just based on how they feel and not actual truth, So the don't actually have to be famous to feel this way for example
+ ENFP: TI trickster causes them to have this mantra: In the absence of explanation/comunication perceptions become reality
+ ENFP: They dont belive in what is true they care what you feel is true
+ ENFP: Absolute truth doesn't matter to them as long as they can cause other people to believe it. And when they succed in that they will start to bleieve it as well.
