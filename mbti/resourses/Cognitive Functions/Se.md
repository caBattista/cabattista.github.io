# Cognitive Function: Extroverted Sensing (Se)

#### Peronality Type: Percieving (Gathering Information)
#### Inverse: Si

### Description

#### CSJ

+ Physics, Present, React to this situation, Gather pysical info
+ About fixing cars, Networking in IT
+ Always aware about what other people are doing
+ See into what other people are doing, so they can decide in what they want to do themselves later, or they know what they want and want to give other people an experince
+ Give other people an experience/sensation
+ Se users are usually on the top (sexually)
+ Linked to NI in an axis
+ Short term memory (Computer analogy: RAM)
+ Good at keeping a lot of information in ther head, but if new information comes it pushes the old information out... (and its not written to a hard disk)
+ Are forgetfull, especially ENTJ, ENFJ, INFJ, INTJ because of low SE and SI being even further down
+ ISTP and ISFP: Swear that they have good memory but actually really don't
+ Manipulation the physical environment
+ Being aware about what is happening right now
+ Being able to utilise tools
+ Disadvantages: Always the guy who is in your cube trying to see what your doing, otherweise they don't feel like they know what they are doing or want to do
+ Advantages: really realist focused, living in the moment, they are not happening the day ...the day happenes to them
+ Behave like tactitions, as an obsticale comes their way they react to it
+ Gives you a good reaction time to any situation
+ Si users would need some time to react to a fire in the house for example where as an Se user would instantly react
+ Would save a Si users Life
+ Se users can't comprehende the concept of 'What if'
+ Is about what is (now), what is someone/something doing, or what did someone do
+ Only have the capacity to think about what if somthing happenes to me, but not about what if something/someone happenes to something else
+ SP types especially think that theory in general doesn't exist. And then they accuse you of being unreal
+ Have very predicable behavior, because they are just going through life doing what they want and trying to find out what other people are doing
+ Instead of actually trying to be original in what they are doing themselves
+ But a few of them can do it (ISXPs), because they are able to take a step back
+ SE hero gets them stuck in the position where they are constanly trying to gather information about whatever everyone else is doing insted of deciding with their NI (because its not developed enough)
+ They are to insecure about their decision about what they want, and think about what if I want the wrong thing
+ It's hard to motivate them because of this
+ But the ISTP and ISFP don't have this problem since they always know what they want, but here the problem is that they can get really controlling with their SE and want to give people experiences they don't want to recieve and make them uncomfortable that way
+ Drives them insane if the don't have somtheing physics/tangeble to show for their effort, because it feels not real to them and they feel really bad about it
+ Have the ability to manipulate their environment in a way that most people aren't able too
+ SE requires freedom, if you take it away they are just going to rage
+ An extroverted sensor has to react immediantely, in contrast an Si user can wait for their Strike
+ They have this thing that if they don't react to it now they wont have the strength to react to it later
+ A lot of gender bias: The majority of women are SJs and they prefer SP Men, and they believe that the ideal man has this mechanical awarnes (SE)
+ Its like that guy that sends you a text message and if you dont respond immediatly they wont tell you what they wanted to say because the energy is lost
+ SE rage (let them decide in the moment)
+ About what is.
+ Really active Function
+ To deafeat SE users: Overwhelm them with posibilities, potential actions that they could end up taking and the consequenses of thos actions (Inverse to NE users)
+ Daosim: Wind
+ SE users assume that everyone is an SE users, and treat everyone the same (when they are ignorant of type and cog funcs)
+ More likely to get Alzheimers
