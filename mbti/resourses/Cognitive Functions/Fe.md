# Cognitive Function: Extroverted Feeling (Fe)

#### Peronality Type: Judging (Deciding)
#### Inverse: Fi

### Description

#### CSJ

+ Ethics, (Output), Your (other peoples) feelings
+ Use Ethics to make decisions
+ Ethics like morals are for FI, and rationale are for TE
+ Is more related to TI (axis)
+ Is basically the functions that allows to feel the feelings of other people (usually FI users)
+ They absorb thos feeling which can cause them to become really (outwardly) caring
+ FE user seeks to make an FI user feel better
+ ESFJs (FE Hero) are super supportive (are the most self scrificing of all the types)
+ ISFJs (FE Parent) almost as caring
+ If you take away their opportunity to care for you or others, you take away a huge part of their self worth (FI)
+ Because FI is in their lower part of their mind they look at their self worth in a negative connotation basically all of the time
+ ENFJ: Although super caring, they are constantly worried about their self worth, like if someone looks at them in a weir way or grunts etc.(They will take this personally and have a meltdown, i. e. feel guilty)
+ ESFJs and ENFJS feel guilty the most by defaul, but INFJs and ISFJs will feel this too
+ If you want to make someone feel guilty you just have to say that you feel bad or that someone made you feel bad -> They'll feel guilty (even though they might disagree)
+ INFJ: do this all the time, its annoying: If there are 2 FE users the INFJ will demand to be in the caring position (because otherwise they'll feel guilty)
+ And if you take that opportunity away from the INFJ they will feel extremely guilty (Emo, depressed, crawl up in a bathroom with the lights of)
+ Millenial depression: INFJs and ISFJs will go so far as to cut themselves, because of the ammount of guilt that they feel, (because they are being guilted by everyone)
+ They are extremely self sacrificing and this is being taken advantage of, and become very bitter that they'll backstab you while helping you (Analogy: cook a meal for you an then poison it)
+ So you really don't want to take advantage of them or they'll hate you
+ FE users have major pride issues...
+ They also struggle with covert contracts (I scratch your back and you scratch mine but we've never actually talked about the terms of that contract) (Now more mr nice guy aout convert contracts)
+ To make them feel better: Allow them to help you and show them gratitude and give them public recognition and they will light up like a cristmas tree, also give them special treatment, becuse that will make them feel special becuase the made them feel special
+ If one FI user that feels bad  walks into the room of FE users the mood of the room will be terrible
+ If there are families with all FE users its terrible because there will be endless guilt loops (I'm trying to make you feel better but no Imtrying to make you feel better) its really annoying
+ People need to understand their cognitive functions, to avoid conficts
+ Have a good mixutre of FI and FE users in your social situations
+ Actually pretend to feel good around FE users to make them feel good as well
+ Everyone needs a wide circle of frineds to have access to all cognitive functions
+ And when they don't have that they end up trying to get certain functions out of people that are not really there
+ children pretend all the time. It's ok to pretend for out social interactions as adults too (all social interaction is manipulation)
+ pretend that you car about what this FE user has done for you, dont user pretence thats bad
+ I already know all there is about this subject: but this guy is trying to teach me so dont just tell them of but actually thank them (pretending), because socially the rewards outwigh the stress, because he will love you
