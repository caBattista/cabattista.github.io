# Cognitive Function: Introverted Intuition (Ni)

#### Peronality Type: Percieving (Gathering Information)
#### Inverse: Ne

### Description

+ NI about questions rather then answers like [[Ne]]

#### CSJ

+ Willpower
+ My (single) Future
+ Way Farther than NE
+ Sniper Rifle
+ In charge of situation
+ process metaphysical info
+ On axis with SE (You are doing something (SE), so I want to do this (NI))
+ Individual will know their own future
+ Predict their own path forward
+ About What I want to do, What I indend, What I desire, My goal, My Path forward
+ Differnt from SI which is like what I want to experience (Past based), and Ni is more about want I want to have/get later (future based)
+ Lets them stay focused (like a sniper rifle on their goal or what they want to do)
+ Ni - Child (ISFP/ISTP): Use it like they have 'liquid luck'
+ Seems like luck to outsiders, especially if Ni is in a primary slot (Hero/Child)
+ Example: ITSP trying to run acros a minefield, somehow by some miracle he is able to get to the other side
+ NI - Child is innocent / devine and get through any obstacle
+ NI - Hero is smiliar in that manor in that INFJs / INTJs body breaks down faster and are more likely to catch disease then other people especially rare diseases
+ But because they have Ni-Hero they're more likely to bounce back from those diseases
+ Eample: someone gets some meningits, or a blod clot and all of a sudden they're back to normal (somehow able to survive)
+ Try to optimise their succes by finding the best path forward
+ Not about trying to go all directions at once, but trying to find a singular path moving forward
+ About going places (movementoriented in a sence)
+ NI - Parent is about being responsible with what they want, (ENTJs ENFJs, dont get stuck in analysis paralysis like other types)
+ NI - Inferior: Being inscure/afraid about what they want (ESTPs, ESFPs), end up not making a decision at all, are notorious for failure to launch syndrome
+ All about desire / fire in you to get what you want
+ Daosim: Fire
+ Really active function

#### Martin Glenn (INFJ)

+ Key Factor of intuition is being able to piece it all together
+ It's about having a subjective negative view of the information that you are aplying togther
+ Cheating example: Alwas having a negative view that you are fucking cheating on me
+ Hearing her voice: And it all came together...

#### Clay Arnall

+ Percieving function not a judging function
+ Perciving is how they gather information
+ NI is a very internal process (often mysterious to other people)
+ Slow process (thats why infs are more withdrawn, for example they will be sitting there for a moment, or stop talking in mid sentence for 20s)
+ Letting it ruminate for a minute, and then it slowly draws conclusions
+ Almost like they are experience life through a subjective replay in their heads
+ Information comes in its ruminated on its narrowed down, and then the conclusions are somehow made, its very mysterious
+ Ni-Loves to come to conlusions and narrow things down (laser focus on things)
+ Its also quite decisive, it loves to pick a path and stick to it, its very good at seing goals and then moving towards those goals, almost with blinders up
+ Almost like INFJs want to sit with an idea for a while, before they really make up their minds, and sometimes just never make up their minds
