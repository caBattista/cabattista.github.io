# Cognitive Function: Extroverted Intuition (Ne)

#### Peronality Type: Percieving (Gathering Information)
#### Inverse: Ni

### Description

#### CSJ

+ Metaphysics: Opposite of physics
+ Multiple Posible Futures of All but not so Far
+ Shotgun, Adapt to situation
+ gather metaphysical info
+ cultural bias: feminie
+ Theoretical
+ About what might be
+ Open to posibilities for others or people as a whole
+ About all possible paths for everybody
+ Ni is also about posibilites but more focused on the self
+ The higher the NE the higher the Ni in the unconcious (and the other way around)
+ Can see paths for every one around them but have trouble seing a path for themselves
+ SP types dont understand ENTP because NE doesn't seem real to them
+ SJ types understand ENTP but still say that entp is way to much in the clouds
+ Precongintive ablity
+ Probability
+ First law of quantum mechanics: If you observer a probability you are more likely to make that probability come true, just because you observed it
+ So if you see all probable posibilities, you can focus on one that you like and make the propper (small) decisions to make that occur
+ Suit sayer
+ You cant just walk around and just know the future, because NE is on an linked (axis) with SI (provides personal experince, all that has happened before will happen again)
+ So that means if experienced something in the past, that means you'll be able to anticipate when it will happen again, if you see the circumstances sourounding it, you will conclud that a perticular actiun will come out
+ This means that to see further into the future or more posibilities you need more past experiences
+ People working in sales are usually people with high NE, because they can sense what you want, Their goal is to understand what your desire is and the craft a sales pitch / deal for you, that fits within your desires
+ If they can't provide what you desire they will ask another person who can and make a deal with someone so that you can make a deal with that guy etc... (hustling)
+ Example: Trading pokemon cards, know who wants what and trate so you can increase your profitability (3 way trades)
+ Best way to someone use their NE (when he is matipulation you for example) is to make them uncomfortable, this takes away their ability to use their NE
+ Really passive function
+ So by giving the an expereince with SE really quick when they dont expect it, makes them uncomfortable and they have to immediately withdraw from the situation and recalculate what their plan is
+ and recalculate their future because of this random assertion someone made
+ Shotgun has this initial SI point and all the posible paths are NE
+ Daosim: Water+ 

#### Martin Glenn (INFJ)
+ Ne is about being positive
+ 'Everything will work out', ...since there are so many posibilites

#### Clay Arnall

+ See the big picture and there fore have a hard time narrowing down and picking one path and working towards a single goal
+ They get sidetracked, look at this shiny thing look at this idea....
+ great at being creative with all the ideas, but have a hard time narrowing down
