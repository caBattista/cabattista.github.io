# Interaction Part: Initiating

#### Inverse: Responding

+ Prefer to initiate
+ Extroverts: Require connection
+ Being in a crowd of 3 or more is a extroverted situation to gain mental energy (1 on 1 is also loosing energy)
+ Will initiate with a complete stanger to get the information they need comfortable
