#### Percentage of Population: 16.7

#### Description

+ Willpower and Truth creates a Beacon of Rightousness for other people
+ Trying to find people of character
+ Ultimate Templar: Jesus Christ -> Heals people through other people(his deciples)
+ 'Firery Sword of Truth' to burn their lies / their lacks (with TI), exposing the person weaknesses (iresponsibility, lack of humility, foolsih, unwise, lack self mastery) to build them back up later (with FE)
+ Turning Enemies into Allies (Law of power always be careful around friends but learn how to use your enemies, give them the opportunity to prove them selves later)
+ About getting rid of charlatanery
+ Guy dies and goes to hell: Deamons who are actually Angels who try to burn the dead mans lies away to save his soul
+ Quickest way to a Templars heart is to take responsibility for your actions (otherwise doorslamm possible)
+ Have the gratest capacity for mercy (if you take full responsibility for your actions (to be righteous), and prove to them that you've changed)
+ but also have the greatest capacity for srew you (doorslam)
+ need people who are faithful to them
+ Without them humanity would be unforgivable
+ Willpower and truth
+ The Firery Sword of Truth is double edged, because it cuts people and the wielder at the same time
+ Are hypocrites, give them selves licence to be irresponsible by not critising any one else about being irresponsible
+ Need to give people the room to change, because it is their responsibility to create and allow rightousness in other people
+ critising other people for not having their life together while not having it themselves together
+ Ignorance of TI when they lack input (ENFJs the most closed minded)
+ Know the truth, but also need to choose to live by it
+ TI is ignorant with perferred input and also with last known input (If they decide they know the truth and be closed minded they stop listening people)
+ They build this 'jenga tower' of truth by canibalising last known input and it will eventually fall over
+ Little FE value system is getting in the way of the truth, preventing them from hearing opposing information
+ Need to listen to the opposing point of view even if they disagree to determine what the actual truth is (Wide TI user)
+ Also give them selves license to behave badly because other people are already behaving badly (mirroring behaver especially INFJ) which they have no right to do
+ The type that call other people out on their excuses are also the ones who make the most excuses
+ They are attracted to people of good integrity, because thats what they want to be themselves
+ Do integrity checks to see if you have a spine
+ Accuse STJs and NFPs (Philosophers) of being spinelss
+ Templars should not be in relationships with other templars, because they will compete about who can make the other feel better, also TI will clash
+ But the can be good comaerade because they learn from each others mistakes
+ INFJ has worst performance anxiety
+ Peter pan syndrom was inveted by templars, because they are like don't have to grow up and be responsible
+ Will sometimes be the other man or women in a cheating scenario
+ They know what the most between right and wrong
+ risks (getting out of your comfort zone) build character: They tell about stories of their succes to buld character in others and themselves (If I can do it so can you)
+ otherwise you become a charlatan in your comfort zone and believe your own bs
+ INFJ hypocracy: The self righteuous suicide (System of a Down)
+ The biggest trush the try to teach: No one cares, Get up and do it because noone cares, It is no ones responsibility to help you!
+ No matter your history -> You are your keeper
+ The toroise vs the hare (Age and tretury always beata youth and skill)
+ The final result of the fire sword of truth is about creating percevierence in people
+ everyone is a hypocitre but you have to choose not to be one
+ Show mercy to the ones who are loyal
+ About when Faith meets the logic
+ The most self righteous of all types
+ Cursaders (habitual -> risks) mimic (they retain those bad habits of other people) people, templars (not habitual) mirror people, meaning they mirror the bad (and good behaviors of other people) so when those people go away those behaviors are gone too
+ Procrastination is lack of desire to engage in risky behavior
+ Listening i
+ More Yang+ 
  
#### Examples

+ Analogy: Inuyasha wields the crusaders sword of Justice (Icy sword of Truth). Sessomaru wiedls the sword of Healing (i. e. Firery Sword of Truth) (Cuts and Heals at the same time) (More powerfull)
+ His ENFJ Dad: Some drug addict comes and wants to talk to his dad and he says he never wants to see him again as he assumes that he is just as bad as he was when the parted ways. But then Josephy convinces him by propsing the posibility that he'd changed
+ His son (INFJ) will do great things, but he shouldn't let it get to his head and wishes his son to tell the trush regardless of the concequences
+ Rockey Balboa (ESTP): Tells his son 'Life will beat you down if you let it', 'Life is not about the blows you can land but its about the blows you can take'
+ The ESTP abusive man child(If they have no self understanding): Im gonna beat my brother to make him strong for life, so other people don't think he's weak
+ Father in law also templar said to his wife who is also templar: I'm not that smart but if I can do (NI) this you can do it too(SE)
+ He did believe his own bs until he struggled and became homeless
+ A righteous man will fall 7 times, but a wicked man will stumble in his foolishness and stay down+
