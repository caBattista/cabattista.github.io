#### Description

+ Knowledge Endurance Percervierance
+ Faith and truth create justice / fairness
+ Obsessed with fairness
+ Use TI and NE to come to the absolute truth about the universe and that life is actually fair
+ About protecting the innocent
+ Are attracted to people (often FI users, INFPs, Gamma quadra) who maintain their innocence
+ Are the 'survivors' the 'endurerers' not so much about thriving
+ Need to learn how to survive first in their life before they can begin to thrive
+ I. e. they need to be on a crusade
+ Need some kind of adversity or they feel like somethings is wrong, i. e. then it is hard to accept being happy
+ Put their faith into the absolute truth
+ Their crusade is about bringing a fiar and just world
+ Virtues and Vices: Faith vs Fear, Cargiving vs Caretaking (Covert contracts), Senserity vs Insensrity, Hyperfocus vs Apathy
+ Very much covert contract people (absolutely expect others to scratch their back if they scratch yours)
+ SFJS more Yang, NTPS more Yin balance in this quadra which is in all other quadra also
+ About the best way of doing something
+ Indirect, Systemactic, Put faith in a System
+ If they put their faith in the wrong system it can have disasotous effects, like losing their loyalty, steadfastness, percervierence
+ Put their faith in justice which is a system to them
+ While SFJ and NTP are very similar, they are usually completely opposed to each other
+ TI clashes with each other, every one of them wants to be the person listened to, which is their hypocrasy
+ If you put people of the same quadra in the same room their hypocracy with show itself
+ They don't listen to each other, Theses types disagree on how to do their how to do sth. 'the crusade'
+ They have different defenitions of fairness and justice and how to get there
+ This is bad for intimite but also business relationsships -> Don't have a relationshipd within your same quadra! (Also true for others)
+ recieves sexually -> canvas in the bedroom (2 canvaces in bedroom is bad)
+ SFJ and NTP can only get to gether if there is a common enemy / adversity
+ Icy Sword of Truth (Is very powerfull and can defeat anybody, but it also creates enemies in the process or (the elder wand))
+ NTPS create they system of fairness and sfjs enforce it
+ NTPS: The ends justify the means, SFJs reluctently agree
+ Icy Sword creates such damage that lasts forever unlike the Firey Sword of truth
+ Eye for an Eye, but this makes the whole world blind
+ If you are harming another person that gives them licence to harm you
+ Can become the tyrants themselves: Analogy: Hitler became a tyrant when he was against tyrany -> hipocracy
+ Will betray their own family in the name of fairness and justice
+ Biggest Sin is to put their faith in the wrong system
+ They don't verify their own beliefsystem
+ Sometimes there are INTP who don't put their faith into anything, making them incapable of percerviering
+ Often are stuck in a beliefsystem from childhood like religion or others taught to them
+ Or the FDA believing they are the experts
+ This leads to ignorance, They need information that challenges their inner beliefsystem at all times to prevent this
+ Are all about: Having to endure tests of faith!
+ Will backstab people if they percieve a lack of fairness or justice
+ They backstab based on puting their faith in the wrong thing and now they are a trator
+ Can build this tower of logic based on the wrong thing
+ Can be then unwilling to admit that they are wrong which makes them very arrogant
+ CAn jump to the wrong conclusions
+ Cultural bias: Feminine
+ The most judgemental of all Types
+ If it becomes bad justice will be vengance
+ Informative
+ Like people who admit to and wear their flaws as a badge
