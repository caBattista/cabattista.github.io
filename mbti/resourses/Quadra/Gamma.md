#### Percentage of Population: 21.2

#### Description

+ Compete for status with each other
+ But at the same time have comeradery which they use to learn from each other (which is nessesary)
+ Pragmatic
+ Are about personal freedom, taking away their choice is horrible for them
+ Are about their performance (important to themselves)
+ Performing means not being abandoned by others to them (Their self worth comes from performing)
+ Have no faith in the human race being loyal to them regardless of how they perform
+ Can't even consider that this is true
+ But have faith in themselves
+ Are you assuming that everyone is a heartless asshole, maybe its because you're shallow
+ Are like pirates (take what you can and give nothing back) (I've seen my dad be this way)
+ Are about achievement
+ Are the sirens in relationsships
+ They control the situation when thier beauty fades
+ Project on to other people that their minds can change on a whim, because they themself are this way
+ Jump to conclusions about other peoples behavior
+ Guard their reputation
+ They will allow injustices onto them or other to take place (because exposing it would hurt their reputation)
+ They will/love travel the most to achieve their goals (My dad is this way, always telling me you need to travel)//Dad said in his test he got alot about being free and stuff
+ Will travel if the other is traveling, to have that share experience which takes their fear away
+ 'MGTOW' Mean going their own way is made by them
+ Have a hard time sharing
+ Noone can own me but I can own them - Hupocrites
+ Cheaters in relationships
+ Want to show of that they can get a perso even if they don't care about them (Cleopatra with J. Cesar)
+ Who want to be loyal to someone who constantly seeks achievents, they might asks themselves am I just an achievement? Will he no longer love me when he no longer sees me as his achievement
+ Golddiggers / Having a trophy wife
+ Assume everyone else is as shallow as they are
+ Don't care about social norms (Fe Deamon/Trickster)
+ Dont realise how shallow they are
+ Repulse their gold and silver pairs (NTPS), no humility, are intimidating
+ Stop taking your pain for granted, thats being shallow, it's wrong
+ Flattering them selves (especially INTJS)
+ All about their own brand (narcissim)
+ Always complain about the quality of their relationships -> The problem is that they are shallow (not willing to accept their own flaws)
+ High relationship standards (That they don't meet themselves) -> Forcing the other person to be fake (not them selves)
+ And then you get dissapointed when you find out that they are being fake
+ Forget everyone who helped them
+ And struggle showing gratitude
+ Think trut h is subjective, Its all about what you believe
+ Purpace is tho have the freedom to persure/gain treasure
+ Advice: Show your flaws so that cursaders can be loyal to you, Share your treasure and journey
+ All about where willpower meets achievement
+ Freedom to choose with whom to share that treasure
+ The most shallow of all types+

#### Examples

+ ENTJ woman getting in to a relationship with ntp men who are stuck in their comfort zone don't work and then they get together and they still don't have jobs but the woman sticks around because she has someone who is dependent on her so she can escape her fear of abandonement of not performing as a woman
+ ESFPS have a hard time testifying on court that they were raped, because they don't want to hurt their own reputation (being a whore)
+ Pirate analogy: Their ship allows them to go anywhere they want
+ A star is born movie+
