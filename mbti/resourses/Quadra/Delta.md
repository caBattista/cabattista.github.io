#### Percentage of Population: 32.8

#### Description

+ Masters of the affiliative
+ They live by what is right, but they also get to define what the right thing to do / what power / what authority is.
+ Position of power/authority (more then all other types)
+ Make the rules/laws, and also the ones who benefit from them if they want to
+ Want to create 'I Win button' in their life, either by sacrificing others or themselves
+ They are the real politicians (Example: Trump)
+ Are usually authoritarians (not libertarians)
+ Use their authority to subject others to their moral standard, for better or for worse
+ They shouldn't get into a relationship with each other: They are all about their own comfort / morale / standarts / mood / what amkes them happy.
+ They compete with each other for status, See life as a pie that is finite and get sliced up into pices, and they want the biggest piece
+ They should be in a relationship with templars: Because they use the firey sword of trtuh to keep them in check, by making them feel gratefull for their position they've gained
+ Can become charlatans, can change the narative to benefit shemselves (with SI)
+ Aristocracy: They are so focused on serving themselves first and foremost, they love it when other people serve them, and they have a tendency to become ungratefull
+ Selfservitude and others serving them then makes them feel important
+ XSTP: expose them for their dirty philosophies and then people don't want to server them anymore (with SE and/or TI)
+ ISTJ are all about credentials and sources, or they wont believe you (with TE)
+ Make it the right thing to do so people server them (Example: They claim that god made them king -> Devine right)
+ Example: ENFP Daughter makes up phony/random rules to controll/manipulate INFJ brother, (ESTP Wife watches this (and intervienes), caution maybe misinterpretet it)
+ Occams Razor: It is choosing sujectively the most likely / or acceptable explanation instead of thaking the time to verify, It is used by them to design their naratives and spin their little webs and it keeps them or others in ignorance, It's the (TE) crutch of the ignorant. (Reductionism and Nominalism) Stefan Moleneux (ENTJ) likes this and uses this often, Credibility means nothing!
+ Their purpace is to use their studious knowlege to be 
+ About when faith meets belief they get the 'philosophers stone'. It is their 'I win button' for life
+ They seek and consume the truth to create this philosophers stone'/'I win button' which will solve all their problems
+ When depraved with sacrifice others for their own gain,  when good thei use their own self as sacrifice
+ They are obessed their whole life with this 'I win button' / #Philosophers stone'
+ They think they are better then other the longer they are in their job, and give the undesirable tasks to the new ones
+ Serfdom is the result when istj rule the world
+ Credibility means nothing, Colledge graduates with bachelors degrees not nowing anything
+ Deltas are overseers of academia, and yet their students dont know anything (They are being sacrificed)
+ Templars should be teaching not Deltas!, Deltas should learn from Templars, Templars dont want to because they dont have the confidence in themselves
+ Very generalised but the templars are the smart people who think their dumb, and the deltas are the dumb people who think they're smart
+ They keep their head in the sand and going with what is comfortable, easy widely, accepteed and use that as an excuse to not change
+ Most resistant to change of all types
+ Lies make them comfortable
+ The law of attraction is the 'philosophers stone'
+ When sacrificing others you are playing god, they like to play god
+ They accuse Ti users of playing god but this is false they are the true ones doing this
+ Nobility is arbitrary, but its tradition so we accept it
+ Most entiteled of all Types+

+ ENFP Car salesman, try to get you in the fine print
+ ITJS killed Gallileo and Socrates, because they didn't confirm their trush but had the actual truth
