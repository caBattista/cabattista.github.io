- ESTPs are triple direct with their interactions
- they’re the ultimate realist: if you’re doing anything “unreal”, they’re going to get in your face about it right away
- They don't plan their day, their day just happens to them (P-Type): “Ugh, I was enjoying my sleep, why do I have to get up?“
- Tactics instead of strategising their day
- Artisan / Freedom based creator, yet also a structure type, Odd one of the SIC types because the don't really want to lead
- Perfectly fine with letting the ESTJ be in charge
- Go along with a situation until their Se hero kind of figures out everything that’s going on
- they’ll start to want to make changes because they’ll realize that the system is dumb
- they immediately take charge and they start tearing down that system, they start building new ones using their freedom-based creative artisan temperament
- to basically artisan a new system, a new way of doing things
- Then, they’re tired of being in charge, and they just hand it over to the ESTJ to manage
- ESTP is not really about management, it’s about taking charge when necessary, doing what needs to be done because they’re the ultimate realist
- ESTPs are like the alpha, of all the 16 types, the ESTP is literally the most attractive type to women
- They even have their own wolf pack, also have the omega around their wolf pack, and they’re constantly just crapping all over the omega and treating the omega like crap
- hazing the omega over and over, or anyone that they perceive is an omega on the schoolyard, or at their work or whatever, they’re going to point out with their Se hero
- and give that person an experience, and let everyone else know around that that person is an omega
- Why? Well, is it because they’re dicks? No, that’s not why they do it. Okay, so it’s all about Se hero, Ti parent, Fe child, Ni inferior.
- Fe child is actually really caring, and it’s trying to give balloons and candy to everybody
- The problem is, is that it doesn’t want to give balloons and candy to anyone that is not behaving the way they should
- Other people behaving they way they should is expert at sensing
- The ESTP gives that person an experience to see how they react. If they don’t react properly, well then the ESTP is going to have a problem with them.
- The ESTP sees the INTJ (FE-Trickster) constantly screwing up over and over all of the social rules and social machinations and social expectations of a social situation, and because of that, the ESTP is like, “Well, this guy is really screwing up, I’m going to treat him like an omega.” Why?
- It’s an attempt to improve the person with their INFJ subconscious, INFJ’s main purpose is to produce better people
- There’s a concept of positive help and negative help: Fe user is usually Fe parents, Fe heroes are all about helping other people, improving them, making them feel good
- ESTPs are not afraid of the concept of negative help: “I’m going to tear you down limb from limb, but then I’m going to build you up afterwards
- They do this with systems, they do this at their job, but they do it with people especially that they actually really care about
- Actually trying to improve others actually, not trying to be abusive
- Walking reality checks, ISTP do this to but way less, and no so focused on the good Person, its more a mentorship relationship long term
- ESTP more short term and more shalow about it, but end up having more positive results
- They use their SE hero to 'etch their soul' of other people they want to help permanently so you always remember, so people will change forver
- Its about persuading people, either physicaly, emotionally, intelectually
- Sometimes you have to get your fists out ... for some real persuasion ...they're willing to go that far if they have to
- Fight fair, they don't like dirty fights, they're always going to fight man to man face to face
- ENTP is going to run away initially, and then hit them back when their not looking
- Channeling their SE rage for the purpose of making their point
- All from the view of negitave help
- Thats why they are the Alpha male Type
- ESTP women do this too, but not as much in like a big things, but because their sacred femininity the will focus on the little things
- ESTP are all about the peopple around them being successfull, they want to impact people so that they have a better experience, a better day, also a better past because of SI Nemisis, because they worry about their onw
- So they want to give other people impactful experience (SE-Hero), so its memerable
- Its all about critisism, ESTP is super focused on critisism
- To make them part of the pack so that they are no longer omegas but bethas, potentially becoming alphas with their own packs later
- They do loyalty checks (SE-Hero), they will purposly push you away just to see if you come back to them
- Loyalty is essential to ESTPS, need people to folow them over a cliff, also expecially in intimate relationships
- Because they will also for dam sure take a bullet for their loved one, there is no grater love then when a man give up his life for their beloved
- There be like I've been focusing on giving (FE-Child) you all this good advice/good experiences (SE-Hero), I want you (NI-INF) to have a better today (SE-Hero)
- I think (TI-parent) that you need to value (FE-Child) things differently. And I want (NI-Child) to show (SE-Hero) you how you can do things better, so that you can give other people good experiences as a result of good experiences I gave you
- Etching each others sould with their (SE-Hero)
- They spen a lot of thime thinking (Ti-Parent) about whats true and whats false, and combined with TE-Critic they will always have to test every rule they come arcost, to see if its valied (FE-Child)
- Because to the ESTP rules are subjective, they are not going to follow the rules for the sake of following the rules, part of that loyalty/reality checking
- FE-Child is about improving other people, they're really willing to invest, teach, others and have them go further, they really want others individuals (not groups) to reach their highest self
- There is this situation where a lot of people end up misunderstanding their (good) intentions (thinking their bullies).
- This is because of NI-Inf so their very insecure about their own future or what they want, this is where ESTP get stuck in their form of analysis paralysis
- They spend so much time looking at what other people (SE-Hero) are doing so that they know what they want to do (NI-Inf)
- But they get stuck in gathering information so they end up not making the decision, this also means that they are hugely at risk for having failure to launch syndrome
- They really do have a hard time getting out of the house, 'What if I want the wrong thing' because they are to insecure about it and end up not making decisions
- And they end up becoming idle, and are to afraid to make descisions sometimes, so they'll make no decision and they'll stay and stagnate
- Thats when they can get really worthless and start stagnating
- Thats when they need someone like CSJ to come around and remind him of the things he taught CSJ
- This reminder has to happen because they have SI-Nemisis, becuase they live so much in the moment (SE-hero) that the old info gets pushed out
- SI-Nemisis causes them to worry about the past, childhood, they get really nostalgic when they get super depressed
- Most sexual of all of the types
- They struggle with being serial monogamists, having many women
- Thats partly because he is so insecure (NI-Inf) about what woman he wants
- SE-Hero has to have sex because thats the only way he can give (FE-Child) a lover a good experience (SE-Hero) and cause them to value him and be loyal to him, so that hes not constantly woried about is past (Si-Nemsis)
- He needs to fill that hole to actually feel good about himself (Fi-Trickster), because ESTPs don't really care about what they feel
- They have ethical awareness not really moral awareness, thats why they constanly ask others how they feel about something or is this an experience you would like to have
- Or have you done this before so its safe enough for me to want it
- ESTPS even though they are classified as being unsafe because SJs 'traditionalists' are very focused on safety
- ESTPS are more focused on becoming safe, and making safe decisions but the problem ist they cant arrive to what decisions are safe on their own
- So they have to do a lot of research, constantly looking into what other people are doing so that they know whats safe for them to want
- They are just so afraid of wanting the wrong thing
- So what you do to help them is to give them options, like hey you yould do this or that etc.
- And thats what NE-Child form ESTJs or ESFJs or even NE-inferior from ISTJs of ISFJs
- They are encoraging the ESTP with lots of different options, so that whay the ESTP feels safe about what they want and then they are able to execute
- Without that support it takes them even longer to gather information and they're at risk for being idle, and potentially putting their manhood at rist
- Because remember they're a control type even though most people acuse them of being caotic
- They are very misunderstood
- They are very critical towards statistics and data (TE-Critic) because they know data can be easily fudged
- They are very critical towards other peoples thinking in general so they walk around (especially when young) believing that everybody is stupid
- But as they get older they start establishing relationships with other alphas and they start to realise that yes there are other smartpeople
- More women are attracted to ETPS than any other type, because of the cultural bias SJ society believe that the estp is the ideal man
- FI-trickser: A lot of people thing they are immoral, They can become religious but if they do they do so in a very dogmatic way and it can inhibit their growth
- Should use their TE-Critic to question to dogma, Dogma is according to steve jobs when people live by the results other peoples thinking
- ESTPs are very weak to dogma, and if they become a slave to dogma they will destroy their and the lives of other people
- Instead they actually need Freedom (of choiche life) because thats the only whay they can get over their insecurity (NI-Inf)
- So they can aspire to become a better helper (INFJs)
- NE-Deamon: They have no awareness or care about anything metaphysical
- Thats why its very rare for them to have a spirutal belief system
- They don't care about other peoples intentions, or what others want
- Because they care so much about figuring out what they want that they don't have any time or mental space to figure out what other people want
- It's not even real to them, they just don't care
- They hate theory, if you talk to them about theory you'll make them upset and ragey, so be carefull about that
- Don't talk to them about theory unless you can give them real statistics and real information to apease their SE-Hero
- They should aspire to the INFJs when they get older, to be able to help and advice
- And practice dogma in a proper way, ESTPs all about testing faith, because they realise faith without works is dead, because of they action orientedness (SE-Hero)
- If they get over their worry they can get into their istj-unconcious, can become the walking ecylopedia
- Over time collect data, and then can stand up to some intelectual types
- ESTPs are all about respect, they have to have respect, anyone they treat with respect they expect respect back
- They expect respect, they live respect, that why they are the alpha
- But their problem is though because their so much that way, they end up losing self respect because they are so insecure what they want
- help them by giving them options by showing them the beaten path etc.
- Super Ego ENFP: (So when they arent able to solve a problem)
- When they hate you and you ask them for directions they will five you directions that will lead you to your death basically
- Or when they are percieving that you are Disrespectfull to them

#### How Each Myers-Briggs Type Deals with Depression
https://personalitygrowth.com/

- A depressed ESTP will often try to make themselves busy, focusing on their daily tasks
- They might even want to go out every night after work, to spend time with new people and new experiences
- ESTPs cannot seem to stay still when they are feeling depressed, and will use activities as a way to keep themselves distracted
- This is not something that the ESTP can really keep up with, so eventually they will crash
- When they find themselves alone without anything to do, the ESTP will probably feel the depressing weighing on them heavily
- If the ESTP has people who care for them, it will really help them pull through
- They need to know that their loved ones will stick by them, no matter what they are going through
- They also need to accept their depression, and find ways to heal rather than avoid
