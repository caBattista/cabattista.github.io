#### How Each Myers-Briggs Type Deals with Depression

- If an ISTP is going through depression, the thing that makes them happiest is being by themselves
- They might seclude themselves for long periods of time, and will completely alienate themselves from others
- ISTPs often will not noticed that they are depressed for a long time, since they don’t usually focus on their own emotions easily
- This can cause them to push others away, in hopes of figuring out what is actually going on
- ISTPs need support, but from a distance
- If someone attempts to smother them, it will only make the situation much worse
- Just knowing that their loved ones are there, and that they can trust them when the time comes to open up- means the world to them
