- ENFPs are some of the most interesting people out there
- Gary vanerchuck is an enfp. RSD Tyler, Tai Lopez etc. lots of succesfull
- Sometimes they can be these high level moralists these super powerfull idealists
- And they do this to basically confer upon others the best knowlege, and break down pieces of knowlege and advokate proper ideas
- But they can also be shisters who can take advantage of you on the used car lot
- Having a relationship with an ENFP or doing business with one os like playing with fire.
- Advocates get a bad rap especially in terms of business situations
- It's because their virtue is charaty, and ENFPs can be super cheritable to basically anyone and everyone
- They do it out of the kindness of their heart and it's absoluztely fantasic
- But sometimes their charaty sometimes has strings atached, and they end up having these super convert contract type strings
- When it comes to ENFPs you always need to read the fine print
- It's because of their TE-Child, it's in the same way how esfjs have a convert contract with life, they have a covert contract with every human being they meet
- It's really earned them a bad and they are basically acused of being the most manipulative / selfish of all the types
- Thats because their vice is depravity, and they dont really care so much about being true to themselves or others as much as they like looking like they are true
- This doesn't mean that they are bad people though, because a lot of the times in this first world society they have these struggles
- People aren't really accepting of them, people will look at them like well you are worthless
- You are novel, what good are you?, You can't even take a hammer to the nail
- And that really bothers them, and so they are left to feel inadiquate
- Remember watching a video of tai lopes and he was talking about him being on his mothers couch in her trailer and keept on claiming about hitting rock bottom
- Him being very novel what should he do...
- But then he finally figured out the secrets that make advocates great
- CSJ has had a lot of relationships with advocates and a lot of them have burned him but also saved his life
- They gave him little bits and pieces of knowlege and it was life saving information, or manhood building information
- But actually quite frankly they are insanely usfull as long as they have tapped into their innerpower of their extroverted thinking child
- NE-Hero: It's all about what other people want, and they have precience and they are able to see all paths forward
- ENFJs just like ENTPs can see all paths forward, like a shotgun
- And then they literally think to themselves every possible situation in their mind and then pick what they feel like is the best path forward to them
- And they then get other people on board and use them like chess pieces and put them in the right position and then it is more likely to become true
- Law of quantum mechanics: If you observe a probability its inherintly more likely for it to become true
- NE-Hero Is all about observing the first law of time: All that has happened before will happen again.
- And they are able to do it in a very moral way, they are all about how they feel and are very sensitive about that
- Often to the point where people can acuse them of being lethargic and selfish
- But if you find one you basically can tell them that they are hurting other people (Hit them in Their FE-Critic)
- Because they are being so lazy, and they'll immediately snap to realise what they are doing is wrong
- And then they will start contributing and then they'll feel good because they are contributing
- An thats in anthing it could be family or activism it could be at home or in the streets, trying to get ideas into peoples hands
- They make amazing marketiers and salesmen, there is no better salesperson then an enfp an infp would be a close second
- ENFPs is all about sales and brand building tai lopes talks all the time about brand story, they are walking brands and they know it
- They can build brands and they can cause other people to become brands themselves, like theses youtubers
- They do this because of TE-Child
- It has a unique capability, its like they can constantly see into the thoughts of orther people and they can change and manipulate the thoughts of others
- A lot of people accuse the enfps of being thought manipulators and yes they do, but its not neccesarily from a position of malice unless the ENFP is willfully trying to take advantage of that person
- But sometimes the ENFP wants to put thoughts into peoples heads so that they actually have a better fututre or on the otherside become a cog in ENFPs grand vision or ideal future that the ENFP sees and is trying to come true
- ENFPs are idealists and they are all about postive social change
- Why are these people trying to help peoples businesses and make people aware of crypto and such
- The are advocating blockchain, because its a very secure cloud storage
- ENFPs like the ENTPs are futurists and they want to create an ideal fututre and bring people along with it
- They want to cause people to know about that idea future
- But to an ENFP literally anything can be truth its not about what is true (like TI-TRickster) it's about what people believe is true (TE-Child)
- CSJ learned a very valuable lesson from an ENFP who hates his guts, and he taught him about the very central core power of the enfp and why they become so successfull in life and it is as follows
- **In the absence of comunication or explanation perceptions become reality**
- TE-Child exists to change the beliefs of people to bring a better tomorow, provided they are not depaved (this is how you can get them)
- If they are depraved they are going to provide a better tomorrow for themselves -> (Find the ENFP who is trying to help you and not themselves or convince them to be better)
- They need to be reminded to care for other people and be ethical
- Yes they are moral but their morals can be verry inward focused, because morality is all about how I feel, it's not about how other people feel
- Then its like ENFPs are more sympathetic to themselves and not empathetic enough
- And they can get such a bad rap because of Ti-Trickster anything can be true to them, and if they can change the beliefs of other people thats what means something to them
- Its about perception is all about a brand
- Truth doesn't mean anyting to them, when they lie they don't feel they are lying, but they kind of are lying on paper because its about the brand etc.
- Because belief has nothing to do with true or false, its about what everyone collectively may precieve or judge what is true or false and thats all the ENFP cares about
- But also because of that lack of TI They really do feel stupid at times
- But they can get over that by doing a very important life technique that i think every single person on this channel should do
- And is part of that core priciple (In the absence of explanation perceptions become reality) of the ENFP
- And the answer was provided by ty lopez and it is reading
- Si-Inf: If they stop becoming afraid of doing new things, because they are just like ENTPs
- They literally can do anything... How is that?
- They use the ISTJ-Scholar and having that own personal library of alexandria
- And the enfp can become that library of alexandria, by reading! CSJ Recomends it
- They can read fast because of TE-Child. It can collect all the important pieces of data quickly. Te-Childs have this amazing ability to speed read
- They can absorb books and reference points like crazy
- Anytime T.L. talks about Ferraries, huge house or pricate jet etc. And he then talks about how he is so successful and the answer is reading
- He has a huge library of books in his house have you seen it, and again they do this because they dont feel smart
- TE-Child is a thought vampire, it latches on to other people heads and absorb their true false logic judgements and it turns into rationale inside the soul of the ENFP
- So by sourounding themselves with a buch of people who know a lot of things or reading they become smarter
- And because their SI-Inf is long term memory access they can remember everything they read so all they have to do is focus on reading
- ISTJ egos can go further than that but is does matter, all they need is to find the anwers to find their path, Thats why they are called the pathfinders like the ENTPs
- Where the ENTP does it more from a logcal systematic point of view where the ENFP does it more from a people focused ideallistic point of view
- TE-Child is also extremely legalistic, they know all about the contracts, fine print etc., if you sign an agreement with the ENFP beware they will own you every single time
- And they do that because they want to feel safe (FI-Parent), TE-Child takes care of FI-Parent
- And that will always protect the interest (NI-Nemesis), because they worry about their own future, they worry that if you are going to make a deal with them that you are going to screw them
- So they make sure that they always have their ducks in a row, leagally, every ENFP he knows has a super expensive lawer behind them because they know they need it
- The problem is they can use that legal capability against you
- ENFPs always have a legal/systematic out
- Warning!: Always read the fine print with the ENFPs Brand. Because without that you are going to get screwed
- But if you can remind them that they need to be focused on other not just themselves (FE-Critic). They become super amazing people.
- Remind them to be empathetic and not selfish, if you do that ENFPs will become insanly cheritable
- They will become the most cheritable people you ever meet. They will stand on the corner for and preching that gospel because it means that much to them
- They are all about finding the best ideas in the world. To increase their status (TE-Child)
- But its also to bring other people along (FE-Critic), just remind them, its super important for them
- Ti-Trickster causes them, to think that anything can be true to the ENFP
- and thats why they care about belief and the brand and the label instead of the truth behind the product
- If there is a label on it they dont want to think, and they'll take advantage of that
- For example making the marketing for a candidate or political movement. And they'll go all out to build that brand or person
- SE-Deamon: Be very carfull if you make them uncomfortable and go after their sense of self worth/ status / reputation, they'll come at you
- And put their fists up and go full estp deamon on you, and phsyically hurt you
- You need to becarfull, because they could be in that selfish mode
- They are more sympathetic to themselves that they are empathetic to others
- So you need to read the fine print, because they can switch those modes at will
- knew a drugdealer ENFP friend who would beat some one when collecting their debt, infron of his own son, thats who cray it can get
- So to make sure to keep your ENFP empathetic, and tell them facts and truth
- And they will feel better because they are walking in truth
- Another thing with ENFPs is if you've done a behavior they will, anticipate that behavior
- So if you really want to go tow to tow with the enfp you will have to give them something new
- And they will have to make SI-Inf go 'whats that i've never seen that before, and then they will have to retreat and go back to the drwaing board and figure out what happened
- It's really the only way to defeat the enfp is basically being an ESTP
- The ESTP can smell that the ENFPs is trying to take advantage of the schoolyard
- But The ENFP can see that the ESTP is bullying everybody in the schoolyard and start rumors etc.
- And starts attacking the reputation of the ESTP and the ESTP has no idea where its going, and they will be super depressed and then the ENFP has won
- Its just how the eb and flow go like that

## How Each Myers-Briggs Type Deals with Depression 
https://personalitygrowth.com/

- ENFPs often go through their depression in various stages, but this can be very difficult for them to overcome
- These usually happy-go-lucky people, will begin disconnecting from the world around them
- When a depressed ENFP goes too long without taking notice to their depressive state, they will begin to lash out at those around them
- They are usually very considerate of the feelings of others, but when depressed they will unintentionally snap at the people closest to them
- They might even seek out ways to tease people, but in a less playful way than they usually do
- This can make the ENFP difficult to be around, especially for people who are more sensitive to the teasing
- They will often find dark humor even more appealing when they are feeling depressed, and will be drawn to the darker side of their personality
- The most important thing for an ENFP who is feeling depressed- is simply to pay attention to their depression
- Instead of trying to pretend that everything is okay, they need to express what they are feeling to others
- Talking about it, and admitting what is going on- is the most important step for an ENFP
- It might be difficult to open up about what they are experiencing, but it is the best solution for them in the long run
