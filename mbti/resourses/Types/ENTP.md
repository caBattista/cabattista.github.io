- The Visionary, the originator, the inovator
- These descriptions are pretty acurate, CSJ is allways coming up with new ways of doing things and this requires a lot of free thinking
- The ultimate nightmare of the ENTP is going into a coma and waking up 20years later and society has change so much that everyones thoughts are monitored by police
- And there is no such thing as free thinking anymore, to the point where any ENTP or sometimes ESTP is shot on sight, because they have 'rebelious' thoughts
- Te-Critic always has to chalange the boundarys and rules
- Doesn't care about things being under controll, can operate in total caos and still meet objectives
- As long as csj has measurable caos, the caos doesn't bother them at all, sometimes evengoing out of their way to inject caos into situation that CSJ believes are stagnant
- In order to get progress / movement going
- Why?: To the ENTPs the Ends justify the means
- Willing to the the things other pople don't want to do in order to reach goals, breaking the social rules to make that happen
- It can be personal goals or goals of the organisation, familiy, comunity they're in
- NE-Hero: Very aware of methaphysics and less aware of physics
- This causes a weeknes that they really cant take a hammer to the nail
- CSJ Thinks Steve Jobs was an ENTP, and there was a movie where steve wozniak acuses Steve Jobs of never taking a hammer to the nail.
- Paying other people to do what he could do himself
- Don't expect ENTPs to build a freaking house. They are just not going to do it. But rather hire someone else to do it
- Often get accuest not being manly enough, because they are practical, and cant change thir own oil etc.
- Gives CJS the ability to have precience, he can anticipate things before they happen, because NE follows the first law of time 'All that has happened before will happen again'
- If he has experienced something in the past he can anticipate when it will happen again
- This requires past Experience with SI-Inf to be able to acurately anticipate the future, but it doesn't need to be an experience that he had it can be other peoples experiences too
- Same thing for the ENFPs, ENPs are the pathfinder types, because NE-Hero is obsessed with finding the right path
- Situations in his life where he was forced to mentally duke it out with someone and the stakes were verry high
- Had a lover who was facing homelessnes and had to have a conversation with her and anticipate every possible siutuation that could happen
- And developed stategies for each situation before they arived and using TI-Parent to create this strategy
- If you mother did this you do this etc...
- And one of the futurea came true and used their contigency(emergency) plan to deal with it
- The ENTPs will even speak like this, thes always have an out just in case
- Why? FE-Child doesn't like feeling guilty for letting people down
- ENTPS are notorious for dipping out. Even at the last minute...
- Either trying to avoid having the personal respnsibility with that situation or they are percievin that its just not safe
- Or we are aware of a future posibility that a unsafe situation might manifest
- For Example at a bar what would I do when a bar fight happenes, so if this happens that I do this etc.
- NE-Hero is about being aware of the constant collective what if.
- What if (TE-Parent) this happens (NE-Hero), what do i do (SI-Inferior)
- IF I see this coming (NE-Hero), I'm going to tell you what i think about it (TI-Parent), so you change your value system on that (FE-Child)
- Randomly talk to people and thelling them this little tid bit of information, because he sees this thing coming and guiding them through it and they will thank the him later
- NE-Hero is all about looking into the Will of other people, its aware of what other people want, what other people are going to do before they do it, their desires their future
- And then he says that one think that kind of course corrects their future a little bit, if they listen and then that does positive things in their lives
- Example of a 26y old guy who wanted a relation ship with a 16 year old and then he told him no (you dumbass) and now his life is better hes married etc.
- **FE-Cild**Â causes the ENTPs to cause people to change their values in a way that gives others a better life, they are really aware of how poeple feel
- ENTPs get bad rap that they are these big assholes that dont really care. Thats no really true
- Oh but you are too harsh with your Ti-Parent and you are abusive, no the truth is harsh and he is going to tell it, so you can grow up.
- Since People tell him the harsh truth through TE-Critic so he has to make changes with his TI-Parent and immedialy change his behavior
- Whats actually true matters to an ENTP, not some kind of dogma or belief etc. You can always convince and ETNP with the truth.
- ENTPS can not live a Lie, and thats a serious problem because ENTPS virtue is sincierity with TI-Parent
- Similar to ESTPs since they also have TI-Parent and they are acused of being harsh all the time
- Its not about that ENTPS are trying to help people, they tear them down so they can be built up again (Breath fire (truth) with TI-Parents)
- What creates a diamond -> Pressure and heat (pain and truth)
- TI-Parent exists to tell the truth for your sake to improve you based on actual truth and not just on how other people feel about it
- Peoples feelings change thruth doesn't change
- Why should we live a life based on a rule or a standard based how people feel?
- Example: We feel like we are overpopulating the planet and we create theses malthusian based laws, come who cares!
- ENTPs test the social norms and traditions constantly and yet ENTPs are very traditional, because of...
- SI-Inf: ENTPs are actually very traditional
- The problem is thought that they end up loving it or hating it so throw it away
- As an ENTP he really doesn't care about thanksgiving dinners that much
- ISFJ mother got to have that traditional dinner
- SI-Inf: is willing to have all those experiences but it has to be comfortable to do so
- SI-Inf: is where the fear and the insecurity lies, for example CSJ trying this youtube channel
- You know how long it took me to finally do it, why? Not because I was afraid of failure but actually afraid of success
- New experiences for SI-Inf make the ENTP insecure and then they get stuck in this rut of inaction
- Because there is this new thing and I don't know how it will go, so im to afraid so im just not going to make the decision
- And that gives the ENTP failure to launch syndrome, in the same way Ni-Inf gives failure to launch for the ESTP and ESFP
- I don't know if im experiencing the right thing? So instead of trying with trial and error the ENTPs decide to do nothing
- It took years to get over that and he still struggles every day anyway
- Fear is the mindkiller (Dune has a really interesting depiction on how fear works)
- When that ENTP aspires with that ISFJ subconcious, and realises that failure is ineviable he just keeps going
- And that pain and suffering and failure actually makes that ENTP into a better human being
- That means if im failing a lot I can anticipate with my NE-Hero what sucess is, and because i failed anywhere else so then all thats logically left is sucess
- So if the ENTP is actually whilling to focus on suffering and pain of life and seek failure to the priciple of the scientific method and to learn and grow
- That ENTP will be more sucessfull
- The ISFJ-Subconcious is ment to take punushment and abuse like an knight in shining armor
- To the point where they can anticipate the future and land killing blows over and over agian
- All because they are whilling to take the risk, its all about embracing failure
- So that when you fail you gian the experience of failing to learn
- Benjamin franklin and Steve Jobs are ENTPS that figured out that suffering and failure are the real hallmarks of success!
- The path to enlightement is through failure
- ENTP-Unconcious:
- NI-Nemesis: This is the worry about the Future, ENTPs worry about their future all the time and every day
- SI-INFJ als makes ENTPs super insecure with their body, to the point where thyey are theses crazy hyperchondriacs who think they are dying
- And annoy their doctors, steve jobs did that benjamin franklin did that, howard hughes another ENTP did that all the time and he was crazy
- SI-Inf is all about having faith, because if you have faith that sucessfull future will be yours
- With probablility with failing many times that probability will come more and more closer to your grasp
- As a starter type im constantly starting these crazy inovative schemes to give myslef a better future all the time because im so worried about it
- The fact that im afraid of failure im also worried about failure
- So then it just compounds and causes this si ni storm that leads to inaction
- You have to get over your worry
- To do that you have to develop your faith, the more you can thake the punishment and the hits in life
- The more hits you take the more experience you have the more likely you are going to find a path with your NE-Hero
- So that you can give yourself the ideal future that you want, such is the way of the entp
- Then using you INTJ shadow mind you can use it to execute it
- Find the vision in your EGO, gain the expereience in your Subconcious ISFJ here and develop it further, and execute your vision in your Subconcious and live it
- You beat Ni-Nemesis through faith, all SI-Useres need to embrace faith
- SI-Parents and like ESTJ and ESFJs don't care as much about faith but they do take it seriously but its usually from a point of tradition
- SI-Hero, Child and Inf take it seriously because they are trying to be responsible with their faith
- Because ESFJs and ESTJs don't want to find themselves over to dogma and blind faith, because the see everyone with their se critic having blind faith in their beliefsystems
- Thats important for SI-Inf do not have blind faith, ENTPs are weak to blind faith just like ENFPs are
- ENTPs believe it or not even though everyone acuses them for being scam artists they can be easily scamed themselves
- They then have to suck it up and take their SI-Inf and take the hits with their ISFJ Unconcious and become a better person
- And build a better future for himself and get over his worry with NI-Nemesis
- TE-Critic: Young ENTPs have this problem where they literally think everyone is stupid
- Why? Because if ENTPs are being responsible with their TI-Parent and then they see other people be irresponsible with TE-Critic
- It wasn't until CSJ swallowed his pried and engaged in humility and open up his mind and learn and because of that he was able to empower his SI-Inf
- And therby also empowering is precience with NE-Hero, and hel build himself a better future, all because he started listening to other people instead of writing them of as stupid
- FI-TRickster: Causes ENTPS to lack morality, don't know how they feel about anyting, are super neutral about everything
- And this is perfectly normal for ENTPS
- ENTPs are more about what do you want (NE-Hero) and what do you feel (FE-Child)
- ENTPs are acused to being a machine that is to logical to analytical and doesn't care about people
- ENTPs need to be around other FI users so that their FE-Child can absorb their introverted feeling and take on their morals and it becomes ethics inside of them and behave ethically
- ENTPs by themselves will eventaully start behaving unethically because they need that moral compass aorund the entp to keep them there
- ENTPs also have a bad rap of being super manipulative, why is that? Their virtue is sinceirity and being about truth but their vice is insenserity
- It's because if they walk around being sinciere and harsh to other people eyes he is not going to have relationships with other people, so the ENTP learns that they have to be insensiere
- And put on a mask in front of society so it accepts them, but the problem is also because of SI-Inf that mask becomes permanent and then the ENTP stars living and being a lie
- They have to have more confidence in their TI-Parent and be like im right! Who cares! I don't care how you feel about it im right!
- But not always sometimes ENTP is wrong and then he has to humble himself with TE-Crtitic and see what other people are valueing
- ENTPs learn really young that people can't stand this type. This is true even with CSJs family
- His family didn't like that he was doing three way deals with kids in his schools with cards etc. and be a little hustler
- And they are tought that they are to out there for other people and they can't handle that
- So they have to learn to lie just so that they can exist in this society
- So you have to ask them if they are being sinciere and the real themselves. Just ask.
- How does it work? If the SI-Inf is comfortable around you they will take off their mask.
- And they wont be fake with you if you can accept what hey have to say they will love you forever and become loyal to you
- XNTJ women. You want to get an ENTP because their SI-Child is everything you've ever wanted. To be able to give them an amazing experience right and have someone who is loyal to you
- To have someone who is not an idiot. Who you can bounce ideas of of and give you what you want thats what these people are for right
- And it all stemms from the fact that society just doesn't like them. The same way people think xNTJ are crazy too. Even though they get labeled as autisitic its rediculus.
- ENTPs have their fellow XXNTs and they band together, and they will take off their mask and be loyal and comfortable around you
- SE-Demon: If you do not make your ENTP comfortable. If you do not allow them to behave dutifully, because ENTPs do not do what they want but rather what they should do. Believe it or not
- IF you do not give them room to do what they believe they should do. To fullfill their duty, To behave honerably
- You are going to get TI-Parented by their ego, but if you are still not listening their are going to try to use their TI-Child within the ISFJ Subconcious to try to outlast you
- If that doesn't work they are going to strategise a way out of their situation, but if that also doesn't work they are going to burn the world to the ground
- This is SE-Demon, just like in the Dark Knight you have ESFP Deamon it exists to burn the world down
- Keith ledger is stuck in his Demonic ESFP Deamon side and all he wants to do is burn the world down
- He was this child abused and PTSD Person that warped is brain and he couldn't take it anymore with his ISFJ subconcious
- So he started do burn things down with is ESFP Caotic evil Demon, ESFP is Caotic EVIL
- ENTP is caotic neutral.
- The ESFP want to burn the world down so that there is a chance that a new life will come tommorrow
- To avoid SE-Demon keep the ENTP Comfortable
- The ENTP uses what you want and desire as a way to gauge their behavior and to understand what the ENTP should do
- The ENTP should not be forced to want to anything out of their own will, they kind of just want to be told what they should do
- Because they have this very serving knight in shining armor ISFJ subconcious in their head. An all they want to do is serve you their lover their society and be appeciated for it
- People don't like ENTP thats why ENTPs are not often appreciated for anything and they are trying to be sinsenciere all along
- Don't allow that to happen and you will have a great loyal relationship with an ENTP that will change anything.
- And because you are empowering your ENTP in that way they will get the ability to change to world as well as the course of the future for the entire race
- CSJ certainly intends to

#### How Each Myers-Briggs Type Deals with Depression
https://personalitygrowth.com/

- If an ENTP feels pigeonholed, or trapped in their current situation- it can cause them to feel depressed
- It is especially difficult if an ENTP feels like they wonât be able to accomplish their goals, or explore the possibilities that they dream about
- They might appear rather down, and incapable of trying new things that they enjoy
- They might become caught up in a schedule, which will feel extremely monotonous for them
- It is important for the ENTP to set goals that makes them feel motivated and inspired
- When they become stuck in a rut of inactivity, it can truly bring them down
- They need to allow themselves to dive into subjects that they truly feel passionate about, not things that they are simply forced to do
- In order to pull out of their state of mind, the ENTP needs to focus on their own desires, instead of the expectations of others
