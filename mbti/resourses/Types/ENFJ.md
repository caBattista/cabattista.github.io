- Very socially oriented
- All about crafting the best social experience
- The best meetings, family parties or any party
- Lotta people think EFPS are the best partiers, nope its the ENFJ (FE-Hero)
- All about how everyone else feels (FE-Hero)
- About ethical decision making
- Know what the collective value judgement is, They already know how everyone feels about everything and they keep track of that
- And they want to bring them up, and if they cant bring them up they are like screw you i'm not going to waste my time with you (You can go hang around mr dark cloud while I go hang around with the people whoa are actually fun)
- Example: Co worker, had amazing parties at his house, a big time roast, bing back deer, and hand it out for his friends, so it was all about crafting and delivering the ultimate social experience, They also love to drink alcohol like all ENXJS especially with friends (They take it very seriously)
- SE child inocently wants to give the baloons and candy, and give the ultimate experience, just like the SE-Child of the ENTJ does but because they are idealists they want to give the ultimate/ideal/perfect experience (going the extra mile)
- Where like the ENTJs will make a work of art, because thats what they experienced, because they feek like that doing, its not like that for the ENFJ the ENFJ wants to do it to make everybody feel good
- Give the ideal experience for everybody, based on how everybody else would feel like
- I feel good about this experience Im giving (ENTJ with ISFP subc.), where as the ENFJ is like your're going to feel good about the experience im going to give you
- Because I want to give you an expereience (SE-Child), that you feel (FE-Hero) realy good about because I think thats best for you
- They make decision similar on how a rational person does, like about how everyone thinks. But they are about how everyone Feels (FE-Hero), So its the good or bad value judgement
- What ever the collective feels is a good thing thats what i'm going to do, so its not about what everyone else thinks, or about how they feel, it's about how everybody else feels
- Makes them super caring and giving, they can easily be taken advantage of because of how caring they are, to the point where they can be treated like doormats
- ENFJs men if its like upfront in their face, their knee jerk reaction to it and then put up their fists and go to blows over it, but if its done to them subtley (subtle manipulation) they are no realy aware of that very much
- They will somewhat get aware if they enough data from past hurtfull experience, or from people around them (SE-Child) detects what the happenings or the experiences of other people detects
- Based on that they might not realise they are being take advantage of sometimes, and it happens to them quite regularly
- So if you're in a relationship with an ENFJ or your doing business with one, realise that they have that weeknes of being taken advantage of
- ENFJ men will be like no thats not me etc. that will never happen, and then I see some being in churches and having all their time and energy taken, all for what ...a 300K$ in debt. church building. Very useful (Sarcasm)
- So I recomend to ENFJS don't pump yourself up, don't get so arrogant to not realise that you're actually weak to the manipulations of other people
- So if it's overt manipulation and its obviouse sure, but if it's covert manipulations good luck, get some help
- For example from ENFPs who are the most manipulative, bacause while their virtue is charity their vice is depravity, which makes them potentially extremely selfish, so that causes to covertly manipulete the high (FE-Users)
- ENFJs also have this proble where they asume that they are being manipulatied but thats not neccarly the case
- NI-Parent (similar to ENTJ) makes the ENFJ want things, and they know they are being responsible about it and they see everyone being irresponsible (NE-Critic), with what they want
- Because of that they become really jaded towards the intentions of other people, to the point where they will walk around every day thinking everyone is going the wrong way, everyone is choosing bad futures for themselves
- Constantly critical of the life choices or decision of their fellow family members or any fellow human being they come acrost, very quick about pointing the finger about how they are living their life
- Especially decisions that will impact other people, beyond them like children for example
- So they really get triggered about other peoples relationships, about someone getting pregnant, or a divorce is happening, or children are being split up etc.
- To handle that you realy need to actually overcomunicate and explain yourself, and that can get really tiring to CSJ (ENTP)
- Example: Hes in a relationship with an ENFJ right now, and he has to explain himself all the time, and as a man he's like really? Why do I have to keep explaining myself...Why don't you just trust me. Because I've earned it. Put many years of loyalty into the relationship etc
- So I havent every done anything so why would I do anything now, but the SE-Child and with TI inferior causes them to think about this: It could (Ne-Critic) be different this time, im seeing (NI-Parent) the patterns
- They look at a situation on a case by case basis
- They have the self licking ice cream cone (ENTJ and ENFJ): Its a selffulfilling profecy, If you keep doubting someone loyalty to you you are going to cause them to actually become disloyal over time
- So they should stop jumping to conclusions that people are disloyal to you, when in reality they are
- So they also monitor them with their SE-Child, but then thats bad to because what Kind of relationship is that
- So I should be able to read their phone and know whats going on, no you shouln't. Thats an invaion of privacy
- Big Covert Contract: So because im giving you the best experience I can I expect loyalty in return and you will give me loyalty no matter what, even blind loyalty, you need to sign your life away to me because I already sing my life away to you, and you can be taking adavantage of me
- ENTJs kind of have that problem but at least with TE you can have a objective discusison about it, but with ENFJs not so much they live in covert contract land
- And if an ENFJ is not upfront with their social rules / games, their TI-Inf will start to thing that thats their standard and then they'll hold you to it even if they have never comunicated it with you
- Not to say that you shouldn't have relationships with, they are amazing people, especially when it comes to comunity, family, when it comes to parenting children, especially in the bedroom or the kitchen
- Either all in or all out, literally black and white, but they also can go as fast to white as they can to black, so you got to be carful and know what you are deling with
- ENFJ especially recomended for SI child or Inf
- You need to be realy realy carful with the TI-Inf of the ENFJs, They will literally believe that they are right all the time, even if the reality says their not
- Deep down the ENFJ is afraid that their wrong or stupid, afraid that their thoughts meigt not actally be true
- They want to find external validation / recognition (though FE-Hero) more then anything, because of this
- Thats why if you tell an ENFJ that they are stupid they will hate you, and there is nothing you can do to get out of that, they will cut you off
- So never tell them that you are stupid, but don't treat them like the smartest person either, because they also know their limitations
- Even they are wrong, still listen to what they are thinking, and respect their Thinking, as long as you at least listen to them and then nicely prove why they are incorect, they'll have no problem with you, because you at least gave them their day in court
- Thats also how to make their super ego (ESTJ) happy, because if you don't their TE-Deamon will come out judge jury and executioner and I will literally kill you. 'This is not fiar. This is not the rules (covert contracts) of the relationship.'
- And they will become this crazy task master that will try to controll everything in you life, that is how ESTJ Deamon comes out, with their super ego
- Without giving them their day in court they will start believing that you dont value them, you have to (over) comunicate with them, more then any other type
- ENFJ men claim they don't want the trivial information but they actually do, dont believe them when they tell you otherwise
- Because the more informed their TI-Inf gets the more smart they feel, the more effective they become, the more confident they become,and they will actually be able to meet goals to become super diligent and productive
- When they get over their insecurity (Ti-Inf), can get into their ISTP subconcoius and become the one most diligent of all the types (same for ENTJs, if they believe they are doing the good thing, they can activate their isfp subconcious, and also become super diligent)
- They need it, so give them all of the context, don't leave out the context, because the are an in charge type and they will make decisions quicky and but they have SI trickster, which makes them forgetfull so they will be forgetting the context to
- Because new data will push the old out (SE), that will make the ENFJ super forgetfull, to try to write things down for ENFJs
- So if you literally become their longtime memory bank, their walking harddrive, their SE-Child will become much stronger and they'll be able to literally give even better experiences, just because you are in their life
- Fi-Nemesis, Because they walk around worring every day about their self worth, another reason why they need that external validation
- IF you have and ENFJs in your company and you don't give them enough external validation, not only will they hate you if they're not getting it, but they will also not be motivated with their ni parent to help
- Because deep down they don't care about the money so much, they don't care about status (Like ENTJs do), they care about recognition/appreciation, and then they will stop worring that they are a bad person
- And because they worry that they are a bad person they hold everyone to this insanely high standard because they are perferctionists/idealists
- But FI nemesis knows that they are not even able to meet their own standards
- A lot of peopple think that by giving to much of this apreciation that they will become arrognat, not so for the ENFJ, because they are already afraid that they are dumb (TI-Inf) and already worried that they are a bad person (Fi-Nemesis)
- They might get momentaraly arrogant with their SE-Child, but not really
- They really need their thoughts and Feeling managed, and the best thing to manage their feelings is telling them how good they are, trough words of Afformation also Gifts but Words even more
- Do demenstrations of loyalty, but don't overdo it
- As ENFJs don't push Loyal people, ENFJs aliante their friends and lovers and family like this, and it will really distroy your relationships
- Guilted very easily (FE-Hero), ENFP or INFP are masters at guilting others so beware
- Hard time forgetting things (SI-Trickster), They strore their memory in their physical environment, so when they have an object they will instantly remember all the thoughts souroundung that object
- E-Mail, Notes, etc. Or get an SI Users (SI-Child or SI-Inferior, or Hero) as your Freind/Partner, but not so much SI-Parent for romantic relationships(hasnt seen that much)

#### How Each Myers-Briggs Type Deals with Depression
https://personalitygrowth.com/

- ENFJs often feel extremely guilty when they experience feelings of depression
- It is difficult for the ENFJ to take the time to tend to their own emotions, which can actually lead to these depressive feelings
- They simply do not feel like it is fair for them to take time for themselves, since they are primarily focused on tending to the needs of others
- If the ENFJ is feeling overwhelmed by their depression, it might exhibit itself in various ways
- The ENFJ will often attempt to work even harder, in hopes of completely ignoring their depressive state
- This will lead to a crash, which might cause the ENFJ to fail to accomplish their usual tasks
- This is completely unlike the ENFJ, which makes it hard not to notice the change
- They will often experience worsened feelings of depression, if they do not feel the support of their loved ones
- ENFJs are always there for the people closest to them, which makes it hard for them to carry on if they feel like they are failing them
- It is important for the people who love the ENFJ to show them as much support as possible
- They need to feel appreciated for their hard work- they also need to feel acceptance so that they can let go of the guilt that they feel for not being able to be present during their depressive times

#### How does depression affect each MBTI type?
www.quora.com

- These types take a beating while depressed
- Their internal monologue has a lot to do with the years of playing roles for everyone else but themselves
- They’ll have these memories flood their minds of past lovers and friends who have wronged them — but only identifying the impressions, not the details in rich accuracy
- Depressed ENFJs will be severely on-edge, but due to their highly extroverted orientation, they might not be avoidant of public
- Their usually open and diplomatic nature will be overtaken by palpable pain, but they’ll try to outrun their unconscious INFP mirror, which knows better than to walk past another corner perfect for crying your eyes out
- Luckily, they see the power in vulnerability, and will likely — slash that, it's cosmically destined — find help
