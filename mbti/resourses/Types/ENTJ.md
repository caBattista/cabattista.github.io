- Also known as the executve
- Very interesting type Personally really likes them one of his favorites
- Always enjoys ENTJs especially successfull ETNJS
- Dagny Taggart in Atlas shrugged: A female enterprenur that against all odds was still able to build a successful rail company and end up to compere in a mens world of business
- Super rational, extremely organised, all about process
- Very similar to how the ESTJ is, they costantly know what eveyone else thinks
- They can literally read peoples minds, because they are just naturally aware of what everyone around them is thinking
- Thats very importantant for them emotionaly, because they are aware of the thoughts around them they want others to think highly of them
- Thats what makes them feel good because they have that FI inferior, this is what causes them to be insecure about their own self worth
- ENTJs walk around thinking that they are bad people or that they are ineffective
- Or they struggle with fear of success it's big thing for them, they will get so successful but they won't beable to handle it
- And it takes personal growth and time to do that
- Also because of TE-Hero that causes their interaction style to become more controll based
- ENTJs get accused of being the most controlling of the types, and tbh. that is kind of true actually
- But thats not neccesarily a bad thing (but can when it inhibits progress or movement in the right direction, so when doing that they only hurt themselves or others from not moving in the right direction)
- But they usually controll so much because they need to have order to prevent chaos, because like all controll types they can't have progress in the midst of chaos
- Where as a movement type like ENTP is like its great as long as im progressing towards my goal
- But from an ENTJ point of view they have to have progress in order to progress to their goal, it's the other way around
- They are very Goal oriented with parent NI, and they are very responsible with what they want
- Maybe a little when they are younger, but as they get older they realise they have a futer and they need to invest in it, so that they can potentially retire at an early age
- Most ENTJs focus is to get rich (Not a bad thing)
- Statistically the ENTJ is the most monitäry sucessfull of all types
- Although we ENTPs are brilliant at times we hav this problem of not finishing what we started
- Where as the ENTJ when creating a company. They have this enterprenurial spirit, but they are being organised about it, they will not leave anything to chance
- Do a lot of research with they're extroverted thinking trying to find out what other people (Se-Child) have done, with sucessfull businesses
- Ni-Parent is responsible, so they use their SE-Child to find out what other people are doing in busessness, and they'll spend a lot of time researching and developing these proceses and wrokflows for themselves and for others to have a sucessful business
- Because to them they can just reduce everything to their ginat task list and then measure it accordingly and have goals
- The Simple Goal system was taught to me by an ENTJ, because they have to be organised with what they do in their enterpenurail and also their everyday lives
- Because if everything gets out of control they are not interested in doing it or its a risk to themselves and others, so they use these systems and techniques to keep things in control
- Another reason as to why they have to do that is because they have SI-Trickster, it makes you very forgetfull for one but it also causes them to be very impulsive
- They're those people that would like impulse buying racks (and also ENFJs)
- They will also intiate with anyone especially in relationships (CSJ has been aproached by ENTJ women in a bar and they took the initiative and they were in controll, which an ENTP finds fantastic but it would drive an ESTP up the wall)
- I want (NI-Parent) to give him a good expereience (SE-Child) in the bar
- ENTJs are not about self discipline they are all about willpower, and if you take away an entjs decsision or take away their willpower they'll have nothing to do with you
- SE-Child is also used to guage loyalty, when they run a company or even a group of frineds, they will expect people to be loyal to them
- They need loyalty they can't live life without loyalty, in a same whay that an ESTP (alpha male of the sensors) does bot the ENTJ is basically the Alpha Male of the intelectuals/intuitives
- SE-Child wants to give everyone around them a good experience
- ENTJs do loyalty checks and voluntarily push people away just to see if they come back
- They do this in business, parenting and romanitc relationships
- Some ENTJ Mother push their children away just to see if they are loyal to them
- CJS things this is bad and you shouldn't push loyal people away because everybody has their limits
- This gets especially bad when their Se-Child and NE-Critic gets together (It contsantly critisizes the intentions of other people)
- Especialy young ENTJs will do this -> Self fulfilling profecy
- When they get more mature they stop doing this so much
- Have a big problem with trust, jump to conculsion that other people are out to get them
- Also don't let other pople get to close to them and put them into a box, Especially bad in ENTJ women
- They like casual sex (Women)
- CSJ ENTP would take a bullet for someone they sleep with
- And then to make matters wors they are insecure about how they feel about themselves, are afraid that they are bad people like ESTJ
- But they should get a hug even though they have low FE and are often labeled as theses souless machine people
- ENTJs have a soft center and you can get to it by telling them that you think highly of them and apreciate the experiences they gave you
- ENTJ virtue is altruism and generosity even though they are often accused of being greedy
- They are afraid of being a bad person thats why they try to show you things
- All about 'can I feel good about myself because you think of me highly yet
- Especially ENTJ women are very sensitive for being percieved as being to masculine etc.
- Are hated all the time and become bitter and don't want to help anymore and become greedy
- Worry about if things are correct, and because of that they go to other people and ask what they think about this and that
- Worry about if they are smart
- Si Tricksert: Are very forgetfull
- Have a lot of short term memory wtih SE-Child, but almost no long term memory
- Store they momeries in physical object or movement (SE), Instantly know all the info for an object where its been etc.
- New information comes in and pushes out the old
- Fe-Demon causes other people to thing that they are uncaring, because they don't care about how i feel etc.
- Trying very hard to be moral, and if you think they are being imoral all you have to do is disagree with them, their TE will latch on to that
- Just say 'I don't think this is good...', their TE-FI will force them to reconcider also their TI-Nemesis will help you in this
- They will immediately change their ways because their lack of SI they have no discipline
- ENTJ subconcious: ISFP ...some ENTJs will have made some beautifull art
- And are about creating the ultimate experience with their great work
- Because all they ever want is of you to think highly of them
- NI-SE: Stagnation will kill them
- Like to have all the informaiton, Knowledge is power to become sucessfull for the ENTJs

#### How Each Myers-Briggs Type Deals with Depression
https://personalitygrowth.com/

- An ENTJ who is suffering from depression, will often lose sight of what is important to them
- They will feel rather useless, like their skills are not being properly utilized
- This is very difficult for ENTJs to endure, especially since they are normally driven and hardworking people
- ENTJs are very good at keeping their depression hidden from others, because they simply don’t want others to perceive this as a weakness
- Sometimes the ENTJ will throw themselves into their work, in order to keep themselves distracted
- In order for the ENTJ to open up to people about their depression, they need to completely trust them
- To an ENTJ it is important that they can rely on the people around them
- If they believe that they can sincerely trust someone, then they will be more inclined to open up to that person

#### How does depression affect each MBTI type?
www.quora.com

- They deal with depression the same way as everything else in life — logically, directly, and aggressively.
- A few thoughts run through an ENTJ’s mind during a busy day at work:
- This feeling sucks, I don’t like this.
- What’s the best solution to this problem?
- Dropping everything to focus on my emotions all day? Sounds excessive.
- “Yeah, Bill, I’m here. Tell me more about those revenue cycles.”
- Next morning, ENTJ wakes up on the brink of catatonic depression.
- *Joins in on the ESTJ’s screams*
