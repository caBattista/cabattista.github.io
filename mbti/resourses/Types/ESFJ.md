- ESFJs The cavalier?
- Typically know to the most self sacrificing of all the types, others claim ENFJ, INFJ
- But CSJ believes that its them because they believe it's their duty to do so
- Have no idea what they want, never ask them what they want!
- Rather tell them what they should to, that's what they are focused on
- Thats why they always ask what do you want me to do or what should I do...
- But when ever a ESFJ seldomly says they want something you need to go in the other direction because if you participate you are going to get screwed
- They thing they want things and then they buy things that they don't have any use for
- They buy a toyota raptor and then leave the car lot like they've just been had
- Or they don't feel like they've been had until other start questioning their decision
- They need assistance in financial decisions
- Worst out all types are worst with covert contracts
- It makes them extremely caring for other people like ENFJs
- TI,Ne,SI makes them have a very strong sense of justice
- FE-Hero: Makes them Walking covert contracts, infact they are at risk at having convert contractis with life itself
- To the point where they think: If I'm a good person good things will come to me. (This is not how it works though, but they believe that aproach)
- They find themsleves getting involved with the wrong people, or find themselves being irresponsible for other people, because of the very large covert contract
- 'If you scratch my back i'll scratch yours', but with life. Hey life i've been a good person so I deserve this...
- Esfjs believe life should be fair, and the go out of their way to make it as fair as possible for as many people as they can
- So thats FE-Hero: Super caring, very self sacrificing all about how other people feel, all about other peoples value judgements
- They would believe that abortion is a good thing when the collective believes its a good thing
- But if they are around a person with high FI, and that person believe its wrong, they will start to belive its wrong too
- Eventually will take on that value system of a group or immediately leave that group entirely
- But thats unlikely since they are Extroverts and people focused
- Only when they get more mature they can be more independent and not succumb to group think
- They have to be careful with circles of friends that they have, and when they get more mature they actually will be really carefull with who they associate with
- SI-helps them with this
- SI-Parent: They have very good memory, their memory lasts forever
- Example CSJs Grandma will remember everything from her childhood when she was 5
- They will bring up things from the past in almost every social situation, how people where feeling in that situation and how unfair it was etc.
- SFJs are built to take abuse, they are able to take a lot of things
- And eventually when they are not in a state of suffering they'll aproach life as if somthings wrong
- And when there is no abuse or suffering in their life they feel like this isn't normal or this is wrong
- The adversity become part of their groove
- They can get super stuck in a routine, this is not necceraly a bad thing (For example when they are in a relation ship with an ESFP its absolutely neccary)
- But if its a routine just for their life then they start expecting other pepole (SE-Critic) to follow their routine
- Like with his Grandma for example if you do the dishes for her you will take away the opporunity to care for others and she will become angry
- Their virtue and vice for the ESFJ is care giving vs care taking, and care taking is a covert contract ->
- I'm going to care for you, but I expect you to give me something in return, but I'm not going to tell you what I expect in return
- I'm just going to call on that favor one day when you least expect it, and you will be obligated to do it, because I initially felt obligated to support you
- They are motivated by obligation, by what they sould do (SI-Parent)
- They need to feel comfortable (in Business or Relationship), if they don't feel comfortable it's going to be a problem
- If they do not feel comfortable or save they will stop feeling obligated to care for you
- Almost all ESFJ men CSJ met are Firemen, has seen it with his own eys a firmen (Big Burly dude) pull out someone out of a fire
- But then they are also really emotionally delicate because they expect others to value him and what he does (also expect to be treated extra special for that)
- So always be aware of convert contracts when dealing with ESFJs
- Child NE: They are childishly aware of what other people want (just like ESTJs)
- They always want to find out about what other people want to do and give that to them
- This makes it very easy to take advantage of them
- But on the other side you need to be carful beacuase there will be a covert contract behind the inintial niceness, so one needs to be carefull not to take advantage of that to much
- TI-Inferior: Never dismiss TI-Inferior, always give it it's day in court, always listen to it eventhough you things wrong or stupid, it doesn't matter you have to respect the ESFJs TI
- If you don't do that the TI-Info will turn into TE deamon and you'll get an ENTJ Superego coming after you. And distroy and control your reputation and life.
- But when you listen to an esfj they will like you, because the just want you to feel good about them, they want you to give them that recognition/and appreciation that FE-Hero craves
- The also want to know that you want them, that you desire them and then they're are amazing in the bed because they want to recieve every sensation you can give them
- Wants to become that canvas on which you write upon, and they'll open up their soul to and allow to you to etch their soul
- Show them you value them by showing them things (What do you want (Ne-Child) to show me (SI-Parent))
- I think (TI-Inf) thats great that you value me (FE-Hero), Thank you for listening to my thoughts that just shows you that you value me
- ISFP unconcious:
- Fi-Nemesis worries that they are bad, so you have to contantly and regularly give them appreciation that they are good for SI-Parent
- Contsanly give them 'Atta boys', if they dont get them they will feel like they are doing something good
- They worry that they don't deserve you, they are afraid that you no longer want them around, and no longer desire be loyal to you
- SI-Parent all about Loyalty, so if they get a hint with NE-Child that you no longer want them, they'll stop being loyal to out of nowhere, bacause you didn't give ne child what it needs
- ESFJ appear to be super low maintainance but in reality thats not true because of the covert contracts
- But if you are a type that natuarally compatible thats not an issue, but if not you have to be carefull and be watching out for that, they are super traditional like that
- SE-Critic: They are super elitist if someone is not regular or following the bouncing ball in life or dressed properly for example, they are going to immediately notice it and it will trigger them
- They will lose respect for people who are not clean or kept etc.
- ESFJs go out of their way to be idealistic about the way they dress, because they know the experience they want to recive (SI-parent) and they will hold people to the same standard with their SE-Critic
- ESFJs talk about how other people are inferior if they go to wallmart for example, because thats not a good environment (SE-Critic) similar to ESTJs
- When ESFJs are younger they can walk around thinking that everyone is just straigt up inferior to them
- You can call them out on their standards (clothing, where they go etc.) and they will be immediately snap out of it
- They will remember there is this standard that I created and then they'll feel guilty (FE-Hero) and stop it
- They are motivated on their duty because of SI-Parent and are Past focused and duty based and they are all about making people feel good, and because of this they can feel very guilty
- They can be guilted into making decisions, and you have to watch out for that or exploit it, because of Ni-Trickster
- NI-Trickster can be a problem because they never know what they want, and you have to tell them what they want quite frankly
- For example: A couple woman ESFJ and they are buying a house together, but she technically selling her house because its her money, and the man out of respect doesn't want to dictate to her what to get
- But actually all she wants know what he wants, but she's not going to do that because of SE-Critic meaning she doesn't want to give him a bad experience in the sales process so shes not going to say anything
- So then he can say i think this is a better house because it will give us a better experience because of these reasons and she will be like 'Thank god you told me what you want' so I can make my decision
- So you can and should tell them what you want up front so they can use that as a goalpost they can be around a home base so to say
- Sometimes SE-Critic will interfere with that but for the most part they will always want to know what you want and how you feel about them too
- TE-Deamon as mentioned before, give TI-Inf its day in court so that TE-Deamon doesn't attack you in a horrible social reputation distroying way with their ENTJ Superego
- Similar to the ENFJ but not so much external, its more internalised for them (controlling taskmaster with the whip)
- If the get over their insecurity with TI-Inf they can becom this brilliant INTP Engineer, and use Symbold/Metaphysics etc that will blow you away
- You have your ESFJ companion and all of a sudden they will talk about physics which you wont expect
- And you'll be like i had no idea you where so interested in physics, and they'll answer that they did a physics minor in highschool etc.
- If they are secure in thinking because you are giving them their day in court they will open up to you in this way
- If you listen to them they will stop being afraid

#### How Each Myers-Briggs Type Deals with Depression
https://personalitygrowth.com/

- ESFJs suffering from depression or burnout, are often very different than their normal cheery selves
- ESFJs care very much for their loved ones, and strive to make them happy
- When the ESFJ is feeling depressed, they will often try to overcompensate for this feeling
- They will rarely express their sadness to others, and will even feel guilty because of their depression
- This desire to push through their situation, will ultimately make things worse for the ESFJ
- They might find themselves crashing, which could lead to inactivity
- It is important for the ESFJ to come to terms with their depression, and to accept that it is not their fault
- They will tend to blame themselves, which can only make things worse
- They need their loved ones to show them support, in order to move forward
- They also need enough space to push themselves forward, without feeling pressured by those around them

#### How does depression affect each MBTI type?

- Tears bursting at the most unexpected moments, their eyes unwaveringly transmitting waves of pain right into your soul. Seriously.
- ESFJs are some of the most giving people, especially to their family
- While depressed, they’ll reach a point where they can’t hold back the tears — and boom
- On the car drive to work, they’ll mentally go over their long list of things to be accountable for, dreadfully unable to redirect attention to themselves (and jeopardizing another rupture of tears)
