#### Percentage of Population: 4.4%

## Descriptions

#### C. S. Joseph

+ Behind the scenes idealist
+ The Dreamer
+ Probably because they are in dreamland at all times
+ All about the daydreaming in their ideal little dreamland
+ Very mysterious type, CSJ loves the mystery
+ INFPs just like [[INTP]]s in a lot of ways are super cute
	+ A lot of them have no fashion sense because of [[Se]]-Trickster
		+ But as they gain experience [[Ne]]-Parent over their years they cab start to gain it over time, especially because they care about what other people ([[Te]]-Inferior) think of them. And because of that insecurity and combining that with [[Si]]-Childs experience they can develop it
	+ But it's not only about visual cuteness, but everything about their voice, how warm they are and just how misterioso at the same time, they just bleed cute all over the place
	+ Sometimes CSJ is around INFP-Woman and he just dies of cute over and over again
+ Are fantastic philosophers unless they are immature then it's more like i'm the social justice warrior who is here to take the pennant or flag of feminism and stuff it down your throught, until life hits them and then they grow up and realize there is more to being a [[Social Justice Worrier]] and really focus on developing a new philosophy, not one that is succumbing to the thrall of group think
+ But because of their weakness they are really insecure about what other people think of them. ([[Te]]-Inferior) and a lot of times they draw their sense of self worth ([[Fi]]-Hero) from that insecurity
	+ It's because they really want people to think highly of them
	+ They want to be the status symbol of people thinking highly of them
	+ Why else would they go out of their way with their [[ESTJ]]-Subconscious to be like that ultimate college professor, who has got a masters degree or a PhD, because they really want to be brilliant
	+ Even though they don't give a dam about having a sense of logic ([[Ti]]-Daemon), it's all just [[Rationale]] in the INFP-land. ([[Te]]-Inferior)
	+ But they can at least get the diploma, which is kind of like the scarecrow, and prove that they have a brain so you all have to respect me now and be this college professor and regurgitate everything I've learned with the filter of my own personal philosophy to guide me
+ To be fair though they can actually become super mega brilliant with that and they can collect those reference points and create something completely original
+ To be honest some of the best literature was composed by INFPs
+ CSJs most favorite INFPs is [[Robert Greene]], he wrote [[The 48 Laws of Power]],  [[Mastery]], [[The Art of Seduction]], [[The 50th Law]] which is his most important book but actually you need to read all of them, they are all great
+ The [[Si]]-Child is able to gather reference points similarly to [[Si]]-Hero, in fact INFPs can become very similar to [[ISTJ]]s and become this walking "Library of Alexandria"
	+ It's not as strong as the [[ISTJ]]s because they are not doing it from the perspective of getting knowledge for the sake of wisdom per se, but from the point of developing their personal philosophy, by taking all the other philosophies they've ever met and cherry picking the best pieces of that philosophy and developing an entirely new original philosophy and then delivering it to everyone basically on a silver platter (Me: This is exactly what he did [[Western  vs. Eastern Philosophy]])
	+ Often times if people will reject the personal philosophy the INFP will get out their whip with their [[ESTJ]]-subconscious stuff it down peoples throughts, but it's never from a negative intention, but because they feel it's their moral obligation to do so and quite frankly it is its
+ This comes from the INFPs [[Fi]]-Hero, which is all about what they believe to be good or bad
+ They always know about how they feel about everything
+ And because they are behind the scenes and are pretty silent, you need to realize that they are always silently judging you, and they'll never admit to it, and if they do at least they are sincere... They're [[Fi]]-Hero can't help but judge you constantly
+ They walk around believing everyone is a bad person anyway because no one can measure up to their [[Fi]]-Hero capability, except maybe like an [[On INFJs]] or an [[ISFJ]] [[Fe]]-parent for some reason
	+ because [[Fi]]-critic allows to pass [[Fe]]-nemesis reviewing stand, because the are holding themselves to such a impossibly high personal standard, and try to get this perfection
	+ And the INFP is like "I'm already perfect", I'm so glad that you're at least trying to be perfect. And that means we can work together right?
+ But they are in all seriousness really fantastic, because the INFP can get that [[On INFJs]] or [[ISFJ]] and who use their FI-Critic your standard is so impossible maybe I could bring you back down to earth over here and you could follow my [[Personal Standards]] and utilize my feelings a Standard, with wich you always know what your boundaries are
+ Because INFP is feeling bad about something, something is wrong and you should change your behavior
+ That's why FI-Critic needs to have a strong IXFP around
+ [[Ne]]-Parent allows them to reach out into the ether, because it's very metaphysical
	+ They can have conversations about the [[Collective Unconcious]]
	+ Collective future of mankind as we know it
	+ And what other peoples futures are
	+ And knowing the fates of others
	+ being able to predict the fate of others
+ Can see the entire System because of [[Te]]-Inferior
	+ And they are afraid of the System and they can see where the System is going ([[Ne]]-Parent)
	+ They can realize that their system is just going to lead us to total collapse of everything / humanity
	+ Work tirelessly to avoid that, by teaching [[ESTJ]] subconscious others their own personal philosophy
	+ To get the proper social change not only for them selves but also for the world
+ How ever like the [[ENFP]], when bringing social change and they are immature or lazy
	+ They can be super lazy because its all about how they feel ([[Fi]]-Hero) and it's all about whether they are comfortable enough ([[Si]]-Child)
	+ If im not comfortable or in the mood im not going to do it
	+ That can take weeks
	+ They need to stop doing that
	+ Its called the "[[Fi]]-Hero [[Si]]-Child" rut (Like an [[INTP]] and an [[ISTJ]])
	+ [[ISFP]] don't suffer as much from that because they are really aware about how other people feel about them in that regard
+ Getting out of that [[Si]]-Child comfort zone is a really big deal
+ If an INFP gets spoiled in their youth, they'll grow up thinking that the worlds owes them pleasure
+ Because they live in this dreamland
	+ INFP is constantly daydreaming or somewhere else in their mind
	+ Really want to bring their adult reality to a close as possible to that ideal dreamland
	+ Where everything is good and everyone things highly of them
	+ And no ones fate is going to end up destroying the world
	+ And that they are having a good experience at all times
+ When they are not able to bring their dreamland into reality they'll end up disappointed, and end up back in their [[Si]]-Child Rut, and are no longer in the mood to do anything and are too uncomfortable to do anything, so then they just have inaction
+ Then their entire world around them is going to fall apart and but they won't notice it because [[Se]]-Trickster is completely unaware of the physical environment
+ So as the world around them crashes the INFP is walking around being completely indifferent to it
+ And it will be their fault because you lacked self-awareness
+ But the INFP will find that scary (the external awareness)
+ Can only bring parts of their little ideal world to the world
+ They should try it thought, but they shouldn't get so disappointed that you'll end up ding nothing
+ Idleness is a big problem for INFPs
+ But even more that that INFPs problem is disloyalty
	+ They have this covert contract which says "I'm so loyal to you and I help you think and keep everything organized for you, and give you warnings of when something bad is going to happen, so that mans I can basically sit and do nothing"
	+ This is especially for the immature INFPs
+ But they can make it happen for their loved ones, they take that very seriously, to the point where they can't even live with themselves if they are failing in that area.
+ The problem is that an INFP has to be taught that it's not something that they arrive to on their own conclusion
+ Because if they are raised in a spoiled environment and because INFPs are insanely literal and take things very literally because of [[Te]]-Inferior
+ Don't have [[Ti]] in them to actually verify things
+ And worry how other people feel about them [[Fe]]-Nemesis and also are insecure about how other people think of them ([[Te]]-Inferior)
+ This causes them to have a hard time acclimating to personal responsibility
+ That's why personal responsibility is really important to teach a young INFP as soon as possible
+ If you were spoiled as a child you can learn the [[The 4 Pillars of Self intemacy]] and can learn how to properly love yourself
+ Because after having self respect and loving yourself properly, other people can actually love you then, and that enables you to love others

+ [[Fi]]-Hero
	+ INFPs strive to be super good and moral people ()
+ [[Ne]]-Parent
	+ They can see into the future, have prescience know what other people want or where they are going 
+ [[Si]]-Child
	+ They prefer for everything to predictable, because that's what makes them comfortable 
	+ If something is unpredictable they shy away from it
	+ That's why they are really shy especially in new situation especially when they haven't had any experience with their [[Si]]-Child
	+ They want it to be predictable, so by making it predicatalble there is that extra sense of security
	+ The problem is if it becomes to predictable or mundane their Ni-Critic will start to loose interest and they won't be in the mood to do anything and get stuck in a rut
	+ So they or you have to force themselves out of their rut
	+ But if you do that it's not good enough to tell them what you think of them, you need to bring many parties and a lot of sources to them
	+ And because of that [[ESTJ]]-subconscious they are all about cite your sources like an [[ISTJ]] would
	+ Make it their obligation to change and present evidence to , so they realize that oh crap all these people are thinking low of me right now. I should probably change, so i can feel good about myself because obviously they don't think highly enough of me
	+ And all of a sudden the INFP starts changing and valuing maturity more (Meeting their needs, having personal standards) and they are only going to be obligated and have multiple reference points from multiple sources of information telling them all the same thing that they are in a rut and need to change
	+ It's not a bad thing inferior, but its just because of how literal they be in receiving ideas and experiences its important that you have the data to back you up because remember they are always constantly silently judging you
	+ Valuing their opinion higher than everyone else's and it will be that way for ever. After all they are just INFPs.
+ [[Te]]-Inferior
	+ They are very insecure about loosing their status
	+ Take their reputation very seriously
	+ People accuse them as to being nerdy, they are really not they are more earthy, not really occult or miserioso they are more fringe. This is not a bad thing
	+ Its a really cool flavor that adds to culture
	+ He knows some INFPs that are really good at learning and mastering specific forms of art (painting, drawing , chello, piano)
	+ They can weave a pattern of how they feel into the chello itself with pattern recognition (NE-Parent and SI-Child) from their own personal experience of how they feel. It is exquisite.
	+ And they can be really self disciplined in that way when they are not in a rut (FI, SI)
+ [[Fe]]-Nemesis
	+ They literally walk around worrying that other people are bad
  
#### How Each Myers-Briggs Type Deals with Depression
https://personalitygrowth.com/

- INFPs are unfortunately prone to depression, in many different forms
- This is most likely because of their naturally sensitive souls, which make them wonderful people, but also causes them to feel things on a much deeper level
- INFPs simply cannot disconnect from the pain around them, and might struggle to avoid these feelings
- They are very caring individuals, and will often feel guilty if they believe they aren’t doing enough for others
- Sometimes INFPs can suffer from depressed feelings, simply because they do not feel understood by people
- They are oftentimes very different from the norm, and do not fit into the sometimes shallow stereotypes of the world
- This can cause the INFP to feel alienated, and misunderstood in a painful way
- INFPs who are depressed might actually start to show their emotions to others, more willingly than usual
- This is often because they are searching for someone who will understand them, and who can help them through this sadness
- It is important for the INFP to feel supported during these times
- Simply being there for them is enough, this might include just sitting in silence for a while
- Just knowing that the people they love are not judging them, helps the INFP immensely
