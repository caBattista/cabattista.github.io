- Likes to dominate the attention of every body around them, because of insecurity
- Really concenrned how other people think of them, external judgement based
- Rally want other people to think that they are smart, so they can feel better about themselves
- So they bring the attention to them, this comes out at partes they are usually the loudest
- Very flamboyant colorful with how they dress, always stick out in a crowd
- They want to give of the best stimulation in how they dress
- Usually the loudest
- ISFJs unconcious, is a really good thing about them, since they are really comited around the house etc. even though it tires them out fast
- Make really good parents
- Can take any boring situation and turn it into an interesting situation with a lot of discovery
- Some have really gone out of their way and make a expereince fun for kids, and come up with games and also make shure everyone is included
- Make fantastic event coordinators, because its all about guiding the right experience
- Other than the other function users its focused about the concrete expereince what people can see hear etc., the content is secondary
- SE-Hero: Always living in the moment. Very good pysical/mechanical awareness.
- Knows ESFPs that can work on cars, picking up a just manual
- Working Sotware too, some even with their INTJ subconciousness become Electrical engineers
- Some ESFP can be really good at calculus or physics and high level math
- Some people think ESFPs are stupid but actually they're not
- Really hands on like ESTPs but in a way that really get other people involed
- They are not much about other people valuing the experience but more about getting people to think about the expreince
- With Te-Child causes them to be amazing salesmen even though they might not know everything about the product
- This is because the always want to make other people comfortable, and hear an see the message, and they will provide statistics and analytics and statistics
- Recomended Career: Sales person
- Not so much good at managing their own finances but the finances of other people
- As long as they are organised they can bank branch manangers etc.
- But they have a problem with finishing what they start often times
- Knows one esfp who went to college 5 times to different collage and still havent finished their bachelors degree (after 13 years)
- They will jump alot around diferent topics or interests, they just want to figure everything out not one experience is limited
- They to this be cause Ni-Inf., they are very insecure in what they want they need to have this freedom of choice
- Have to find out what every one else is doing first for them to figure out what they want to do
- This can lead to failure to launch synrome, analysis paralysis, they get caught and stuck in this data gathering mode
- Because they are so insecure with what they want
- Fi-Parent is responsible with their self worth, how they feel, their morals
- Alwas can tell you how they feel about everything, they have super quick responses on that
- If something is percieved as bad for them they are not going to have anything to to with it
- So how do you get around that tough nut to crack
- You can use TE-Child, if you say you think so highly of them because you give me a good experience, you are always the life of the party etc
- Telling them that will make them feel really good about you, and you can start having a good relationship with them
- But FI-Parent can cause them to become lazy, if they get stuck in this situation where they constantly have to gather informaiton and they don't know what they want
- This is because they are so focused on right now, and their future is so far out of the way, and they are gathering so much new infromation so that its pushing the old one out
- And they dont remember that they have goals to reach and responsibilities that they have to meet, so that they don't end up 40 without having children etc...
- Life will pass by them super quick, if this goes on. They then have a mid life crisis, because of this
- The also have a very hard time looking at their own future because they have inferior NI and that makes them really afraid.
- And this fear gets wors because they are constantly trying to manage what other people are thinking about them, because this feeds their Self-Worth (FI)
- They draw their self worth based on how others around them think of them
- If others don't think of the well they will be stuck in the SE-Hero trying to gather information, to try to figure out what they want to solve the problem
- It becomes this endles loop for them
- So they need someone to support them basically.
- Someone who focuses on how they feel and let them to whatever they want, someone who is willing to share their thoughts with them, give them possible options about the future for them
- Similat to how an ESTJ does for an ESTP, but here an ESFJ does for an ESFP
- The ESFJ would constantly support the ESFP
- Also SE Hero needs people who are loyal to them, because sometimes SE-Hero is aware that they are not the best person in the world, especially when they get lazy. They know it themselves
- So they need people who are loyal to them for when that time actually comes
- As much es everyone tries to Depend on the ESFP the ESFP is actually looking for someone they can depend on themselves
- They can conduct a lot of energy but being a source of energy is really hard for them, so they need someone to get that energy from, to augment that anergy for the betterment of those around them
- SI-Nemisis: Is similar to ESTP-Si Nemisis
- They get cought in the past really easy, they worry that their childhood wasn't good enough
- Get really nostalgic when they are depressed, they worry that their Memories are not Memorable enough later
- They constantly try to make new memories (with SE-Hero) so that their SI-Nemisis doesn't bother them as much
- They typically want to travel and see the whole world, but when they cant they get super depressed because they werent able to reach those dreams
- So this is why they constantly have to be the life of the party in order to make the worry and pain of SI-Nemisis go away or be manageg
- A loyal SI-User in a relationship with the ESFP. The SI-User will be like hey lets go do this. Or lets go have this experience
- The ESFP no longer has to guess or come up with an experience for this other person, because they have already made up their mind
- And the ESFP will be like, Awesome! Thank you lets go do it!, They are always down for everything.
- As long as they have an SI-User thats loyal they will absolutely let them take the lead.
- Or sometimes the SI-User wants them to take the lead and they are happy to do that because they have that mental energy to do that.
- This how they combat SI-Nemisis
- They also have this problem with SI-Nemisis, that they can be unreliable sometimes, they have problems reaching their comitments
- Simlar to the ESTPs but its even worse for the ESFPs because they have FE-Critic, they don't really care about how other people feel
- So this really becomes a problem with their comitments
- FE-Critic: It really critisies the value Judgements of other people
- They have FI-Parent so they are really responsible with how they feel but at the same time really critical of others and how they feel
- They see how other people are really irresponsible with how they feel
- So you can use this on them to teach them something by calling them out about them being irresponsible with how they feel.
- This will hit them hard because they are alreayd in tune to that, and it will be like dam i missed that
- Call them out on how their lethargy and stagnation is really hurting others, and then they'll realise it and snap out of it and start being productive again
- Yes you can guilt an ESFP into being productive, because the FE-Function is really where someones guilt exists
- But it will only last for a little bit so you have to constantly keep doing it
- Thats why SFPs are built for SFJs because SFJs weild guilt as a weapon and it motivates SFPs into action
- But with that the SFJs also provide option for paths moving forward
- ITs an amazing thing to see happening, bacuse they are a movement oriented and they will be moving fast and put all their energy in there
- When they finaly know what they want
- But they are always at the risk of fizzeling out so hit them in the critic
- When they are young they literally walk around thinking that everyone else is a bad person
- But eventually as they mature this getts better. But for the most part they are like i feel like you should be thinking about that, to the point of maybe even acusing the other as being stupid
- Or being a bad person or unethical
- But because they have such a high own ethical standard you can always call them out on that, because they take they high ethical standard very seriously
- Ti-Trickster: This is why they get such a bad rap
- Because basically people think they are stupid, and they find ESFPs to be amusing meaning without thought
- They are basically incapable of producing logical thought, they cant think if this then this is true etc.
- But they have TE-Child which allows them to borrow the thinking of other people in the form of reference points research etc.
- If you want to make an ESFP smart souround them with intelligent people, very quick
- And they can create their own mini encyclopedia of the experiences that matter to them
- Its an amazing thing, They are actually verry rational, They are taking the information from other sources and putting it together and thats rationale (TE)
- NE-Deamon: IT exists to screw over everyone elses Future even people in their own family
- They are usually not aware of this but thats what happens because of NI-Inf
- If the person close to the ESFP doesn't give them the freedom to want things and make their own decisions the ESFP will hate them
- And the ESFP will make decisions that will screw over the other persons future, with ENTP-Superego
- So this means they will wait for the oportune time to strike, and they will strike when you least expect it and hit you where it hurts the most
- They best whay to defeat your enemy is to attack his heart, this is what they will do and distroy your relationships with other people
- Because you decided not to give them enough freedome or weren't loyal to them
- I feel (FI-Parent) that you are a bad Person because you thought (TE-Child) it was ok to betray me (SE-Hero). And I dont want (Ni-Inf) a relationship with you anymore.
- So I'm going to do everything to retaliate and make sure to distroy your future (NE-Deamon) and all of your relationships with other people, you will be exiled basically

#### How Each Myers-Briggs Type Deals with Depression
https://personalitygrowth.com/

- ESFPs who are feeling depressed, might attempt to try new and exciting things to pull themselves out of it
- They might even attempt to spend money, in order to purchase things that they believe will help them feel better
- ESFPs love aesthetics, so anything beautiful will lift them up for the time being
- These things of course do not last, which might cause the ESFP to dip into a depressive state where they seem much more down than usual
- When this happens the ESFP needs their loved ones to show them plenty of support and attention
- Without people around them the ESFP will find it impossible to pull out of their depression
- So when they are with an SI-User
