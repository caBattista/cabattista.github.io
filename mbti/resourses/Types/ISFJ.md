## How Each Myers-Briggs Type Deals with Depression
https://personalitygrowth.com/

- ISFJs are often seen as happy individuals, who strive to help those around them
- When an ISFJ is suffering from depression, they might find themselves more closed off from the world around them
- They will often be afraid to step out of their comfort zone, and will attempt to revert to things that have helped them feel better in the past
- If these things don’t ease the ISFJs sadness, they will often feel more hopeless
- They might find themselves spending time just sitting at home, failing to socialize with their normal group of friends
- Having the support of others is one of the most helpful things for an ISFJ
- When they have people around them who express how much they care and want to help the ISFJ, it can really ease their discomfort
