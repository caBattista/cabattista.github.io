#### How Each Myers-Briggs Type Deals with Depression
https://personalitygrowth.com/

- Depression can be a real struggle for INTJs, mostly because they are logic minded individuals
- Depression often causes rather irrational thoughts, which is something that can be extremely frustrating for the rational mind of the INTJ
- When an INTJ feels overwhelmed by their feelings of depression, they will often attempt to search for things that can quell this problem
- They might try diving into things that have helped them feel happy before, but some of these things are not the mostly healthy outlets
- INTJs might resort to drinking or reckless behavior, in order to find a happier state of mind
- This will often fail to help the INTJ feel better, since they will quickly feel guilty for indulging in pointless things that will not move them forward in any positive way
- INTJs in this state of mind need to learn to focus on what they are good at, and trust in their instincts once again
- Being in a depressive state can be extremely difficult for the INTJ to break out of, mostly because they will not ask for help and might even revert into themselves
