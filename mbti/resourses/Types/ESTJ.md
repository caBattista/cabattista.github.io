- Take Charge
- Traditional
- Statistically most pysically fit of all the types (eating right, gym etc.),
- Very good at middle management, HR, systems & processes & compliance
- About making sure the group is compliant to the process (ISTJ creates/tests it -> ESTJ implements it)
- Self discipline
- Have to be comfortable
- Like new things & experiences (as long as they are responsible)
- want to optimes the experiences (make it as good as it can get)
- Not as open to try anything as ISTJs are, but still pretty open
- All about what other people want (NE)
- If tell them what you want (NE)... they'll look at you funny asking why you want that (TE)...
- Then they will be like: I don't feel like (FI-Inf) you should think that (TE-Hero), because it would give you a bad future (NE-Child) which would give me a bad experience later (SI-Parent)
- Because if you're having a bad future (NE-Child) you're going to end up giving me a bad experience (SI-Parent), because I have to deal with your stupid (TE-Hero) and I dont feel good about that (FI-Inf)
- NE is about giving other people what they want, Extroverts about giving baloons and candy and advice yay (introverts all about recieving ballons and candy)
- Si-Parent makes them on the bottom in the bedroom, they like to recieve sensation (including men)
- But they also can be a giver with their SE-Critic but that will tire them out
- FI-Inf.: They are very Insecure about things and their self worth, (They walk around every day being afraid of being a bad person)
- You can use this by telling them that you think (TE) they are a good person, because of XYZ, and they will feel really good about themselves
- To Social engineer them: Give them a good experoence, Always state what you want, Tell them that you think really good of them and they will love you forever and be so loyal to you, die for you
- Tough front (TE) but really soft center (FI)
- Eventually they get over their insecurity and aspire they can have this really high form of morality
- And when they do that they have this super mega deep one on one conversations with people
- ESTJ-Egos are really shallow people, because of their SE-Critic causing them having a very elitist point of view with how people look
- Example: When they spot you having your shoe not tied, or when you have your cap worn backwards on their head they will lose respect for you instantly
- They are all about first impressions, because of their SE-Critic, holding themselves to an impossibly high standard of looking good at all times, which is why they are at the gym all the time, because if they have access body fat they cant live with themselves (especially in thier youth)
- So when they loose their excess body fat, they remember they put in the effort (SI-Parent), so they think you should be able to do what they've done (SE-Critic), and you would want to be able to do what I've done
- This doesn't make them a bad person though, because they already feel bad, so if you tell them they are amazing anyway you can have a great relationship with them
- ESTPS totally, like to ride that SI-Parent with that SE hero
- If they can get over their moral insecurites (FI-Inf), they can become like this super deep dreamer (INFP)
- ESTPs (should) study as much phylosophy as possible when they are young, so when they age they can become the INFP (becoming super helpful and give advice, and then they get so dissapointed (SE-Critic) that that noone is even listening to them)
- So they are like you should (SE-Critic) probably listen (TE-Hero) to me, and you would want to listen to me (NE-Child), because I've been around the block (SI-Parent), and I feel bad in the past (FI-SI), because of this issue and you would want to hear about my experience (SI), so that you know(TE) what you can do (SE-Critic)
- They worry about wether or not they are smart, right, correct, accurate (TI-Nemsis), resulting in them constantly having to take their ideas to other people with (TE-Hero) and be like 'Hey, what do you think about this? Would you want to do this?'
- Basically get all the external input from others to get over their worry
- (SE-Critic): Tries to give other people a good experience so that they get really perfectionistic, for example when they throw a party they want to have everything super perfect, need to be the ideal party or they don't want to do it at all, but when they actually do it they are amazing
- (SE-Critic): And they also hold themselves to this insanly high standard to how they dress, how they sound, how they walk, how they posture, (You shop at wall mart you're such a looser)
- About going into pysical environments (SE) that could lower their status (TE) to feel good (FI), They don't have to be right (TI-Nemesis) but as long everyone thinks they're cool they can feel good
- In the absence of comunication / explanation, perceptions become reality, TE exists to change, manage and manipulate thought and to cause people to believe things, all about changing belief, doesn't actually have to be true logically (TI-Nemisis)
- ENFP and also very much the INFP, can become really malicious whith manipulation other people thoughts, beliefs, perceptions for their personal gain
- ESTJs don't do it as much because they still rooted in reality and not metaphysics like INFP or ENFP is
- Will never know what they want (NI-Trickster), so stop being afraid of telling them what (they) you want and just tell them directly! (Best friend type is ESTP, highest compatibility, and they are tripple direct)
- ESTJs will make bad purchasing and investing decisions, like buying a car (They can be sold esily as long as that person makes a good first impression)
- And all of a sudden they think they want something, but then they realise this isn't really the experience they wanted to have (after its happing for a little bit), and then they end up disengaging (which is really frustrating for them and everyone around them, but it's not their fault because of (NI-Tricktser))
- They are not aware of the best path that they should take. They just try to experience everything that they can, and then figure out and decide wich path to take later, after experienced all paths
- They will often complain that they live their life 'backwards', because they will have all their fun life when young, but when they are older they wont do anything interesting anymore
- But by actually accessing their INFP-Subconcious on a regular basis, they can actually become this amazing philosophy professor or choach to choach other people
- FE-Demon: They don't give a dam about how other people feel (or are even aware of it), because they are only really aware about how they feel (FI-Inf), so they don't care about ethics or social order / protocol / social minutia as well
- Don't expect them to care up your problems, never bring up your problems because they are very aware about the problems that they already have with their FI-Inf
- They don't even have the mental space to comprehend that other people have problems around them that they can't solve
- Unless they are in their INFP side, they can help someone with philosophy, but they are not going to do it to make them feel better, but it's about giving them a better future (NE-Child)
- They don't care (at all) about making other people feel good, infact they wand everyone else to give them a good experience (SI) and making them feel good (FI)
- Will make fun of at every opportunity they see (SE-Critic). When did you learn how to tie a tie, fashion emergeny / police
- Super ego ENFJ: When they are really really angry they turn into this very cruel human being, because they will takeverying they've negatively experienced forcing it down your throught (SE) and remind you about how much of a horrible person you are(SI), poetic justice
- So if you ever wrongend an ESTJ they will remember, they do hold grudges, and they will take revenge on you if you push them to far
- They are all about loyalty (SI-Parent) -> Never push a Loyal person, to the point where they don't give a dam
- Don't loyalty check them, (by giving them a bad experience with SE)
- They will be like I deserve better than this because I've done all these things for you and put up with your crap for so long, and you have the audacity to push me over a clive just to test if I bounce back, srew you.. You just burned the bridge i'm moving on...
- ESTJS espicailly whith SI ciritc do not take that at all. Thats why with their SI-Parent they are really best to be with SE-Hero (SE-Parent also ok)
- Mom says dad is not really good at sports, but he kinda is
- There has to be enough SE to make that SI parent comfortable, because SE child doesn't have enough energy to make SI-Parent happy, and there is also this parent child relationship, the parent will just parent the child, especiall with SE-Critic 'the old man' so thats not going to work to keep the SI-Parent Loyal
- This is so my mom, and it explains exactily why their relationship never could have worked

- They might become more high strung, and go through bouts of manic behavior
- They will often attempt to push forward, but this might lead to a crash which causes them to struggle to get out of bed
- ESTJs are hardworking people, but sometimes this effort does not always seem to be yielding positive results
