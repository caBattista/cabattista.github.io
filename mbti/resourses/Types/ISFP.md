#### How Each Myers-Briggs Type Deals with Depression - https://personalitygrowth.com/

- ISFPs have very strong values, which can often lead them to conflict in their lives
- They hold their values very deeply, and will often become unhappy if they feel them being challenged
- If someone close to them continues to push against the ISFPs beliefs, it can cause them to sink into a depression
- This can be very difficult for the ISFP to overcome, especially since they only follow a path that they believe is right
- It is best for the ISFP to take time for themselves, and to avoid negative people
- They need to be able to absorb positivity in their surroundings, in order to get themselves feeling right again
