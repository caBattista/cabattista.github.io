#### 16 Personalites
https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality

Strengths

- **Creative** – Advocates aren’t exactly like everyone else – and that’s a wonderful thing. People with this personality type embrace their creative side, always on the lookout for opportunities to express themselves and think outside the box.
- **Insightful** – These personalities know all too well that appearances can be misleading. Advocates strive to move beyond superficiality and seek out the deeper truths in life. This can give them an almost uncanny ability to understand people’s true motivations, feelings, and needs.
- **Principled** – Advocates tend to have strong beliefs and values, particularly when it comes to matters of ethics. When Advocates talk about topics close to their heart, their conviction and heartfelt idealism can inspire and persuade even the sternest of skeptics.
- **Passionate** – Advocates crave a sense of purpose in life. Rather than living on autopilot or sticking to the status quo, they want to chase after their ideals. This isn’t a personality type that shies away from big dreams – in fact, Advocates are energized and impassioned by the beauty of their visions for the future.
- **Altruistic** – People with this personality type aren’t happy to succeed at another person’s expense. Advocates want to use their strengths for the greater good, and they rarely lose sight of how their words and actions might affect others. In their heart of hearts, they want to make the world a better place, starting with the people around them

Weaknesses

- **Sensitive to Criticism** – Advocates aren’t averse to feedback – that is, unless they believe that someone is challenging their most cherished principles or values. When it comes to the issues that are near and dear to them, people with this personality type can become defensive or dismissive.
- **Reluctant to Open Up** – Advocates value honesty and authenticity, but they’re also private. They may find it difficult to open up and be vulnerable about their struggles, not wanting to burden someone else with their issues. Unfortunately, when Advocates don’t ask for help, they may inadvertently hold themselves back or create distance in their relationships.
- **Perfectionistic** – The Advocate personality type is all but defined by idealism. While this is a wonderful quality in many ways, it doesn’t always leave room for the messiness of real life. Advocates might find it difficult to appreciate their jobs, living situations, or relationships if they’re continually fixating on imperfections and wondering whether they should be looking for something better.
- **Avoiding the Ordinary** – Advocates yearn to do extraordinary things with their lives. But it’s hard to achieve anything extraordinary without breaking it down into small, manageable steps. Unless they translate their dreams into everyday routines and to-do lists, Advocates may struggle to turn their grand visions into reality.
- **Prone to Burnout** – Advocates’ perfectionism and reserve leave them with few options for letting off steam. People with this personality type can exhaust themselves if they don’t balance their drive to help others with necessary self-care and rest.

- CSJ wishes sometimes that they slowed down (movement type), not going to happen though
- The idealist who is all about perfectionism, I hate INFJ perfectionism
- Then they come off as someone who’s super arrogant and prideful, which is not their intention but thats how they are coming off
- TI-Child has to be right, FE-Parent automatiacally believes that they are the ultimate socialista that can navigate every social situation, and they know people
- You try to teach type to INFJ and they will be like no I already know people better then everybody else, if that was the case you wouln't be alianating all of your friends
- And complain that you are alone all the time
- NI-Hero: All about choosing the best path forward, INFJs are extremely wanty they are all about what they want
- Never try to tell the INFJs what they should do, always ask them what they want instead, always allow them a choice in what they want
- If you don't do this they will be very ragy quickly because of SE-Inf
- FE-Parent is what makes them super social justice oriented, kind of like the ISFJ but not as justice focused they are more focused on fairness and really expect other people to have moral behavior
- INFJs constantly judging the ENTP for not having moral behavior while simoultaniously claming that they know people
- If an INFJ doesn't know type they don't know people
- If they are just judging you for being moralles or not having feelings, they don't understand you even though they claim they understand everyone, like hypocrites they need to stop this
- The INFJs Purpose in life is to make other people better, that is how useful you are
- That's funny because INFJs desperately want to be the most useful tool in the toolshed, because of FI-Critic
- INFJs literally walk around believing that they are bad people, that they are worthless every single day
- And they are constantly trying to overcompensate with SE-Inf and FE-Parent to try to prove that they are useful, and they overcompensate
- And at times because they are overcompensating and the SE-Inf performance anxiety they have
- And they are afraid of giving people a bad experience, they are afraid of coming of as poorly as sounding bad or looking bad and they spend lots of time in the mirror to fix themselves
- And they are really insecure about it
- They don't need to feel so bad, CSJ loves their sense and their clothing etc about them, They are absolutely fantastic, they have no reason to be insecure about how they look or how they sound
- They will even go so far as to lower their voice, and doing the 'INFJ whisper', It's so meek and so fake at the same time, CSJ is like come on just be real with me, stop being so insecure
- If they are real about their voice and they get out of their INFJ whisper crap, they will sound like a very demanding ESTP-Alpha type person, who the INFJ really wants to be
- They want people to be super loyal to them, if they could just get over their insecurity they would probably get that wolf pack very easily
- The wolf pack: A close group of friends where they completetly regard the INFJ in a good way and respect and appreciate them
- Because FE-Praent craves recognition not like INTJ credit but appreciation saying thank you, and they expect everyone to have those manners, to say thank you etc.
- The problem is FE-Parent can enforce that so much that their like im so responsible with being social and how other people feel so you need to responsible about it too
- So they start forcing other people to have manners, even thought INFJs often do not keep up with their own manners
- They have this insanely high moral standard for everyone else with their FI-Critic so that this just causes other to be alianated, not everybody can handle that
- xNFPs can handle that wich is fine and even NPs in general can handle that because their introverted sensing can put up with that punishment from that SE-Inf
- But only FI-Hero or Parent can actually stand the punishment, given by FE-Parent
- So what do you do? You have to call them out. So you be like hey if you expect me to be so moral in this social situation then why is it last week that you were swearing at this one person...
- Just bring up the past. Talk about all the times where they had moral failures and they are not the best person they imgine themselves to be, or the most social person
- And quite frankly they really dont. They walk around feeling worthless all the time but its just a facade of pride the put up because of SE-Inf, because of this performance anxiety
- SE-Inf is so insecure about giving someone else bad experience, they are so insecure about perfoming badly and people not valuing them anymore because they just want other people to value them
- But the problem is that they alianate people with their super high moral standard that they hold for themselves, and expect other to follow this super high moral standard they have for themselves
- And its impossible to even do that since the INFJ can't even keep up with their own high moral standards, So come on and stop holding people to this impossibly high moral standard and also stop holding yourself to this standard!
- Oh wait you cant. So you need to use your TI-Child to get to the truth that some people just cant get to that super high moral standard
- FE-Parent be ok with it. Other people are not like you!
- INFJS are also mirrors. They mirror behavior. If you put an INFJ in a group of bad people they will become bad. They will pick up all the habits. Because the SE-Inf will just start absorbing all those habits
- And absorbing everything that group does, they'll start behaving the same way saying the same things
- It's very easy to create an INFJ satanist, just leave them around Satan worshippers and then you have an INFJ cultist or satanist
- Or insert any religion or spirituality there, because they don't really care and want to latch on somebody else or a very close knight group of people
- And they want to create this family like, blood oath like environment, where everybody almost is in love with each other but die hard loyal about each other, willing to take bullets for themselves and the piers in this group
- Because an INFJs walks around that they are definately willing to take a bullet for their friends
- He even knows INFJs who are willing to rob banks for their friends, if their Firend cant afford something they'll do it
- INFJs have to understand the truth (repeating what he said before)
- If you stop alianating people, that other people have to uphold you moral standard to make you happy
- And then they will feel like they don't want to be around you any more
- Everyone he meets has this problem, and the only ones who were able to cope is the onse who created theses close circles wolfpacks of people who just follow them around
- You know kind of like Jesus and the 12deciples. Jesus was an INFJ
- And fine you can be that super high moral standard with your close group of friends but please be more understanding to outsiders, be more understanding in general!
- You are supposed to be the avatar that point of the spear the tip of the pyramid the capstone that really divides the world and bring about new social change and new social order
- That tears down the system and rebuilds it and brings betterment for man kind
- So what business do you have alianating other people with your super stupid high moral standards that you cant even follow it doesn't even make sense!
- It's emotinally abusive! Don't do it!
- FE-Parant can cause them to be guilty at any second. They can go like 0 to guilt instantly. And they are so easily guilted
- If you are in a relationship with an INFJ don't guilt them, it's not fair because they can be so easily guilted
- In fact they can take actions because of that guilt that they would never have done normally, or be ok with doing, but they do it because they love you so much
- And they can be easily manipulated into doing that. It's one of their biggest weaknesses
- Sometimes though when you guilt them and they know you are insenciere about it, and they know that they are being unfairly guilted they will get ragy and violent real quick, with their ESTP subconcious
- And they will start criticing you,and holding you responsible for every little thing that you've ever done
- INFJs are aware of social opportunity costs, So they'll be like you had this opportunity to do this nice thing for me but you never did it
- And then they will be all in your face and start questioning your loyalty to them
- Because SE-Inf needs loyalty, INFJs need loyalty more then everything!
- Jesus said if you are ashamed of me then im ashamed of you. It's SE-Inf. It is about you being loyal to them
- Why? Because if I go out of my way to care for you (FE-Parent) and tell you how I think about things (Ti-Child) and criticise you to improve yourself
- Because TI-Child is all about critising other to improve them
- I'm going to critisise you untill you are blue and broken down. But hey i'm going to build you back up again
- It's not that they are intentionally trying to hurt you. You have to look at it like this
- Ti-Child is like hellfire it exists to burn the lies away
- And because you know the truth you will then you will no longer have that problem
- It's all from the point of view of trying to solve problems
- We'll if you din't purchase that car you wouln't be having a bad experience right now, if you had listened to what I said
- The problem is its a child so their thinking is not always 100% correct
- So they really need to be around somebody who is rational, because rationale is somthing that can guide them in their thinking
- Because it's TI-Child they end up taking things so literally, that while they are being literalists (and that can be annoying) it actually does help them stay acurate, which is great
- ENFJs are also literal in that same way but INFJs take it even further with TI-Child. And TI-Child can be absolutely brilliant
- Every INFJ CSJ knows for the most part ist brilliant in some way. And a lot of people its like social briliance but no CSJ knows a lot of INFJs that are brilliant in psychology
- CSJ was mentored by an INFJ in the topic of depth psychology
- And he has his close group of friends he cares for, and holds them to this super high moral standard
- The point is they go out of their way for people, to their own detriment, because of their FI-Critic they believe the dont deserve good things in Life
- INFJs don't really buy themselves nice things that often, unless its for the purpace of helping some one else
- Or for them to get a job so they can help their family, because they need income for some reason
- Fi-Critic causes it to be even worse sometimes. Some INFJs don't even take care of themselves
- CSJ notices, that INFJs often don't know how to drive because they have no ethical reason to
- They are not going to learn how to drive, only if its for the sake of someone else
- They don't really take care of themselves unless its for someone else
- Especially male INFJs if they don't esteem themselves they are literally going to wake up that 30y old and they are the most worthless humans on the planet
- And then they call CSJ and ask him for advice. Thats super common. Dont be that INFJ don't be that looser.
- Spend time now in your youth to make yourself better and don't have failure to launch syndrome
- Did you know that out of all the types the INFJ hast the highes failure to launch synrome problem
- To like actually not leave the home, they stagnate
- They think they don't deserve to be good or things didn't work out for me. They are walking excuses!
- But INFJs are actually amazing at sales for example, because their ENFP uinconcious. Of course they are amazing at sales
- They can be amazing at construction, and INFJ who was a professional Painter (There is a lot to painting properly)
- They can also develop a machanical genious if they apply themselves
- The problem is good luck to get an INFJ to apply themselves 'I don't deserve to apply myself noone is going to feel like they like what I do
- And I feel worthless and useless all the time, even thought you want to be the most usefull person in the toolshed
- Guys stop being a walking contradiction and realise you already have all the skills within just develop them. Have Faith!
- I don't have faith because I have SI-Deamon, I need to see other people have faith in me. CSJ: I do have faith in you!
- CSJ: I beliece in INFJS I take them very seriously
- You know the only reason why people think you are wothless is because you think you are worthless. Stop doing it!
- Ne-Nemesis: They are very paranoid. Just like INTJs. To the point where an INFJ will often acuse their lover of cheating on them all the time
- It's very common of an INFJ to acuse their partner of cheating just because they are not spending enough time with them as they used to
- SE-INF needs die hard loyalty and consitancy
- If all of a sudden if you their lover is out of pattern. Their Ne-Nemesis will jump to the conclusion that you cheating one them
- A friend of CSJ comes home to his INFJ wife who acuses him of banging his own brother. WTF. That is super disrespectful. And she's only doing that because she is spitefull
- With that FI-Critic, you are not consisten enough form me and not following my super high standards right now so because of that you are abviously cheating on me.
- CSJ ended a very close relationship to an INFJ, because she disrespected him 4 times like that and CSJ needed to retain his self respect
- Never push away a loyal to the point where they no longer give a dam @INFJ
- INFJs do theses loyalty checks that push people away with their FE-Parent
- Similar to the ESTP with their reality checks INFJs are about loyalty checks
- So when they are insecure they're ESTP side pushes people away. And do theses loyalty checks
- Let me push you over a cliff to see if you still like me afterwards
- Im going to sleep with this person in a data center just to see if you are still loyal to me. Thats how crazy those check can get.
- You think the ESTP loyalty checks are hard, whered you think they are being abusive. Wait until you see loyalty checks from an INFJ. They are way over the top.
- Because of NI-Hero this happens. NI-Hero can go way to far with it. Because they cant guage the level of experience you are going to deliver
- When you are ahoving that much NI- Through an SE-Outlet. It justs starts comming out like a giant blegh. And then you are like whoa what the hell was that
- You get whipplashed. And because they are momevement and they come at you way to quick. And then they acuse you of being inconsistant and disloyal
- And then its like you pushed me this far. Who is right? It would be CSJ not the INFJ.
- So remember its a serious isssue.
- Only a few types are able to give them this loyalty and thats SI-Child types (INTPs and INFPs) and SI-Inf type (ENTPs and ENFPs)
- They really need that hardcore loyalty
- To really solve that FI-Critic problem you really have to go out of your way to make them feel loved and make them feel valued by saying thank you for everything they do for you
- You have to give them recognition, you have to give them kudos
- INFJs really get off on shynies. If you are at a tradeshow and see them selling like a sphere off copper and give them to your infj and they'll think its the greatest thing ever as weird as it sounds.
- They love jewelery. They love bling. Because of SE-Inf takes away their insecurity and they will look good infront of other people.
- So give them anything that makes them look good
- Give them a super amzing awesome car like an audi. Or anything like that they crave that.
- If you are an FI-TE User and have that. That INFJ craves that status. Because of their ENFP-Unconcious and it just has to have that status that you have
- Because also they want to be regarded and valued as the most usefull person on the planet
- And you know what INFJs are.
- They can literally be the most usefull people one the planet
- But they can also be the most worthless
- Their virtue is integrity (very usefull), their vice is corruption (very worthless)
- There are INFJ men in their 30s and 40s that have done nothing with their lives
- Because they are making excuses because they never got a chance
- You never had a chance because you never allowed yourself to have a chance
- But the good thing about an INFJ is they can grow very rapid
- So even if you are 40y old you can make up all that lost time within 2years or so
- If you know all the steps, and you get educated and look at what other people have done in the past (SE-Inf)
- And you think about logically whats the true path about it (Ti-Child)
- And plot yourself a course with Ni-Hero
- The one true path. The most efficient and effective path forward
- Ni is looking for that one ideal path forward instead of the many possible paths
- And INFJs can bounce back rather quickly
- Even with their health. SI-Demon will cause the INxJs to be unhealthy
- They will start working and doing things and they wont even realize that they've cut themselves
- And believe it or not SI-Demons end up having the rarest desieses, but because NI-Hero they can get through them
- They have these crazy survival stories
- Because their Ni is able to will through life
- They can literally make people better, by inspiring social change
- They will be and are not as worthless as the voices in their heads
- And they just need to stop listening to the voices in their heads and stop making excuses and get of their asses and do things and be usefull for once and engange with people
- Talk to people make people feel better and improve them, tell them the truth, inspire them
- They just have to realize that they are not as worthless as the voices in their heads tell them that they are
- The truth divides the soul it burnes the lies away, why because if you burn down the forrest new things can grow
- Thats what TI-Child is all about, they are telling you the truth innocently, they are not really trying to harm you our hurt you
- They are not trying to make you feel like an idiot, they are not trying to sound pridefull even though they come of pridefull
- We'll i think this and I don't care about what you think.
- Why? Well its TE-Trickster
- It is not aware of what other people think
- INFJs are only aware of what they think themselves
- They are not aware of processes, Never let an INFJ do finances. Thats a bad idea. Unless they understand Mint.com
- They always need help with their finances
- Because an INFJ is more about giving away all you money instead of making proper financial decisions, at least the immature ones
- RAtionale is just not their thing. They don't do data, they dont do spreadsheets
- INFJs in school will get into trouble because they wont be able to show their work, because they tried to do it all wither their Ti-Child in their head
- They can't do it because they have TE-Trickster
- Stop holding everybody to the same standards. Not everybody is a TE-User public school
- And you are making it really bad for INFJs and ISFJs because they have TE-Trickster
- Maybe an ISFJs should stop making excuses and actually reform for once
- SI-Deamon: It can become the ISTJ Superego
- The SI-Deamon will sell you down the river
- NE-Nemisis will get so paranoid that they'll assume that you betrayed them
- And their SE-INF will just start raging
- They will elect them judge jury and executioner
- They will look at all the evidence that they have in their head
- Not even looking at your evidence or defence
- And they will literally cut your head of, they don't care
- They've already made up their decision in their mind even though its no true
- Be carefull. You always should affirm and demonstrate your loyalty to the INFJ
- You alwas tell them how much you appeciate them. And their contributions to you. You always tell them what the plan is
- INFJs cant plan to save their lives because of TE-Trickster, yet they are a J-Type so they have to have a plan so
- they deal with that by asking you to come up with the plan, and then because that plan is the standard in which they can work in
- Its boundaries in which they work in
- You have to tell them how you feel, they don't know in which boundaries to work in, and they don't understand the rules because they are looking for you to provide them
- If you dont give that to them they are going to freak out. And they are going to feel like they aren't being usefull to them
- And then all of a sudden they will start feeling worhtless, because they think they are not contributing to you, even though they are
- Because you are not giving them recognition that they need, you have to meet their needs
- Every type has needs in a relation ship
- They need public praise so that they feel valued by other people, to beat back the worthlessness feeling plagueing them every single day and that will never go away
- They only way they can compensate that is being super usefull to other people and hoping that they are getting the recognition for it for once
- Alwys ask an INFJ about what they think. They are innocent with what they think. But because of that innocence, because it is a child its actually accurate.
- It can only be inacurate if you don't give them all the information
- However an INFJ that is using their SE-INF and getting over their insecurities. They start researching and that makes their TI-Child even stronger and acurate and brilliant
- Let them know how amasing they are in bed
- Having bedroom relationships with an INFJ is fantastic for SI-Infs and SI-Child
- Give them kudos on that, but if they are bad tell them so they can improve it, and give them recognition an thanks for that
- You are just a canvas on which they want to paint upon
- If you are going out pattern tell them why
- You need to comunicate with them. Tell them how you feel, just give them the recognition and appreciation, always ask them what they think
- Be honest with them, tell them how great they look and how they sound etc.
- Give them information about what they are thinking about
- Because they know what they want that causes them not to trus what other people want
- FI-Critic: They need you. So if you need help always state and give them the opportinity to let them help
- If the offer you to do the dishes let them do it or they will feel like the most worthles humans on earth dont do it
- Recognise that they have TE-Trickster. They often are sharing their thoughs and then other people are being like why are you telling me that i already know that
- But they didn't know that those other people would know that, and step into these situations elegantly when you already know that theses people know that.
- And than the INFs is no longer at risk of alianating those other people.
- They are just trying to be usefull and tell the truth, but when they are tying to tell that to other people because they already know that and it seem like the INFJ is talking down to them
- And then they end up feeling like the INFJs being holier then thou even though thats noth their intention
- SI-Deamon hurts their bodies, but if you take car of your body, when you are in a relationship with an INFJ and you have self discipline and are comited to health
- The INFJ will do it to because they are mirrors
- SI-Deamon means they have no self discipline thy don't even have a proper sleeping pattern. That you as an SI-User have
- And they will do that to because the are afraid of making you uncomfortable and they always want you to be comfortable
- Then INFJ is willing to lay their life on the line for the sake of their fellow man. Thats why they are the spear and the apex that really drives social change for people

#### How Each Myers-Briggs Type Deals with Depression
https://personalitygrowth.com/

- INFJs can often suffer from depression, this is likely because of their compassionate nature.
- INFJs see things, and they notice what is going on in the world around them.
- While some people can shut themselves off to the pain of the world- INFJs feel everything and are incapable of closing themselves off from it.
- This can cause them a lot of pain and heartache in their lives, especially when they see so many people who lack compassion or a desire to help change things
- INFJs can go into a depressive state, if they feel powerless to help others- or if they simply feel overwhelmed by the world around them.
- They know that they are meant for greater things, and they strive to make a real difference in the world.
- Sometimes though, the INFJ will become saddened by the pressure that they place upon themselves- especially if they feel like they aren’t making any progress.
- This depression can overwhelm them, but they need to let go of their guilt and realize that they are doing their best.
- It is more than acceptable to take time for themselves- in order to heal and replenish their souls.
- Their depression can often show itself as self-abuse, and the INFJ may become even harder on themselves than usual.
- It is important for the INFJ to remember, that even the smallest difference is a truly a big deal.
- Many people in the world aren’t even trying- while the INFJ is doing whatever they can to ease the suffering of those around them.
- Simply committing one small act, can change someone’s life- and if anyone is capable of showing this kind of life-changing kindness, it is the INFJ.

#### Duality 
www.youtube.com

- ENTPs say the INFJ is known for beiing aware of others subconciousness, before that person is aware it themselves
- When INFJ walk into a room that is what the INFJ brain is trying to do automatically (out of their control for the most part, but might be manageble with effort)
- The INFJ brain is trying to read all theses subconcious transmissions of everyone, and your 'Laser' is going haywire because its going from one person to another
- This is why you'll notice INFJs will stand to the back of the room, because they can be more observant and relaxed and habe a better perception of whats going on
- When the INFJ is on the inside of the room they will have a lot of blindspots, they can gather more information from the 'outside looking in'. This is how they are with society in general.
- INFJs like to decypher so many people and things, This comes often times from their Child-TI but actually with all 4 of them working together
- INFJ Memory-Style is more specific and more a subconcious memory. Thats why infjs will say that they know things but they don't know how or why.
- They really do know things but it's hidden deep in their subconcoius
- They often have this problem that when they explain sth. it makes sense to them but not to others.
- Peoples standards are based on their cognitive inlcenations and standards, if unaware they will often times expect others to think and talk like them
- INFJs pick up patterns, they notice patterns with society at large or individuals. Example of knowing how someone would respond to rules
- People will ask the infj how they know that and they will respond with I don't know where this came from (But it comes from looking at patterns)
- INFJs will be very intune with their environments, and they also become confused with other peoples feelings (thinking that they are their own)
- So when INFJS come into a dilemma with other people they have to think about if its what they feel or what the other person feels
- Ni is ver abstract, so INFJs often use SE to explain things instead
- Sometimes other humans become so predictable that they don't feel like real humans anymore, which is scary for the INFJ
- INFJ don't believe in free will much, since they observer so much (Free will, divine intervention, and programming)
- Shadow can take over their concious self
- Others see INFJs as judgemental because they don't see the patterns, Example: when he sees a bad person other pepole wont under stand why he is judgemental
- Would sit at every table in highschool, which was seen as unusual
- Example: Others would think hes black because he could to relate to them so well
- Other people said to him to get out of their head
- It bothers him when he cannot see somthing in their personal life (like financial or work)
- Every Type has their own internal questions and for the INFJs its: How come you cant see this? How come you can't see whats going on?
- ISFJs: Why don't you remember that? You don't remember him doing that or what happened that day 25 Years ago?
- ISTJ: Why don't you remember this sepcific Information. How come you cant remember this tyre sise for this vehicle
- ENTJ: Might also critisi your informational memory
- ESFJ: Why cant you clean up after yourself? Why is everything left up to me? Why are you so quiet?
- INTJ: How come pleople don't know how to fix things or do things on their own?
- ESFP: Why are you so serious? Why can't you loosten up?
- INFJs can be so truthful so that it will hurt pepople feelings.
- Difference between INFJ and INFP: INFJS will care more about objective truths and the INFP and ISFP care more about subjective feelings
- Popular people on YT claiming to be INFJs are usually not INFJs, and the real INFJs their channels have very few subscribers
- ENFPS or INFPS channels are much more popular
- INFJs will ususally be a low key talking person and have very deep kind of conversations
- Other people say Gut-Feeliing is intuition, but ISTJs also said that they have gut feelings, but its unclear to him
- People confuse gut feelings with intuition, according to jung and myers those are two different kinds of intuition
- Had other people tell him that hes mostly a logical thinker, but also others told him that hes emotional
- Shows more the logical side of the personality
- INFJs hava many layers of tolerance and understanding but once they really get pissed of you need to get throug all the layers in the other direction
- But there also people who get pissed of easily and also forgive easily
