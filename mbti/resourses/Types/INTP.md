#### How Each Myers-Briggs Type Deals with Depression
https://personalitygrowth.com/

- INTPs are normally very controlled, especially when it comes to their emotions
- When they are suffering from depression, it often shows itself in stages
- Initially the INTP will attempt to push themselves, and might even try new things in order to break out of their sadness
- They might spend some time attempting to socialize with others, when the depression first arises
- After they attempt to socialize though, the INTP will often feel exhausted and need to revert inward
- They might spend long periods of time alone, in hopes of easing their discomfort
- Their indifference might make it rather hard for others to even notice that the INTP is depressed
- An INTP who is extremely depressed, will have emotional outbursts, and this can be extremely surprising to those around them- since the INTP is normally so reserved with their emotions
- If they are feeling pressured from those closest to them, it might result in them snapping at those people
- INTPs need to feel like they have a safe place, without feeling pressure from those around them
- They need to be allowed to feel whatever they are feeling, and honestly just need space to figure things out

- The INTP also lacks resourcefulness when it comes to depression
- They might drink heavily; smoke weed; navigate social media too much
- INTPs are a very quiet species, but they wish to find someone to understand and engage with them holistically
- While depressed, they might just seek out a friend because their intuition says they need to try something
- But odds are they’re one of the most helpless types when it comes to interpreting their complex underlying emotions
